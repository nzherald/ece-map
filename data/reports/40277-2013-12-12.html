</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>TopKids Totara is located at Totara Point, a developing commercial and industrial area of Taupō. It provides all day education and care for children from birth to school age in two separate age-based rooms. The centre is licensed for 80 children, including up to 24 children under two years of age. At the time of this ERO review 80 children were enrolled, 26 of whom were identified as being of Māori descent. The centre operates under the ownership and management of Kidicorp Ltd, a national early childhood education and care provider.</p><p>Since the previous ERO review in 2010 the centre has been relicensed, to merge the over-two and under-two licences under the <em>Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008</em>. A recent and collaborative review of the philosophy has resulted in specific statements of practice for each age-based area. Teachers aim to work alongside children and provide them with an environment where they can make choices and initiate and revisit their learning with the support of parents/whānau, staff and the community.</p><p>A new Kidicorp area manager was appointed in late 2012. She is providing sound advice and support for aspects of professional services and financial management. Centre leadership and staffing has remained the same.</p><p>The centre philosophy expresses a belief in providing children with choices and opportunities to initiate their learning. There is a commitment to respecting Te Tiriti o Waitangi, tikanga Māori and strengthening te reo Māori in the centre. An open door policy enables parents to share in their children’s learning and have opportunities to engage in conversations with teachers about their children.</p><p>In keeping with Kidicorp policy the service maintains a higher than expected number of qualified and in-training teachers to work with children. A significant proportion of teachers have their own children enrolled at the centre. This is contributing to the settled environment, strong sense of family within the centre, and the ability of the service to retain experienced and valued staff members.</p><p>Significant improvements and extensions have been made to indoor and outdoor learning environments, which have enhanced spaces for the education and care of children, and the professional needs of teachers.</p><p>Recent and ongoing professional learning and development for teachers has resulted in positive changes to assessment and planning, with a focus on identifying children’s interests and building on their strengths.</p><p>Some progress has been made with the area for development identified in the 2010 ERO report in relation to documenting children’s learning and progress. A further recommendation related to strengthening the partnership with parents remains an area for ongoing development.</p><p>A recent focus on including te reo Māori and tikanga Maori In the programme has resulted in a greater presence of Māori language and culture.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Effective governance and management for Topkids Totara Street is provided by Kidicorp Ltd. This is evident through:</p><ul>
<li>the centre’s clear vision, philosophy and strategic direction</li>
<li>appropriate policies, useful guidelines and frameworks, quality assurance processes, that inform centre operations and procedures and contribute to a sustainable service</li>
<li>sound financial management</li>
<li>regular self review that is focused on centre development and improvement, teaching practice and positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>The knowledgeable and experienced area manager is committed to positive outcomes for children and their families. She provides valued professional leadership and support for the centre manager and teachers, through ongoing professional development, regular reporting and responsive feedback.</p><p>The centre manager and head teachers have established a culture of collaboration and open communication that is highly valued by staff and families. The dedicated centre manager demonstrates a commitment to enhancing teachers’ practice and continuing to build a quality service for children and families. Shared decision making is increasing the understanding and sense of ownership of staff members about centre operations.</p><p>Teachers are strong advocates for providing a curriculum underpinned by <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and best early childhood practices. The curriculum is effectively designed and implemented to promote children’s development, learning and understanding of the wider world. Particular strengths observed by ERO include:</p><ul>
<li>the inclusion of, and responsiveness to, children with identified special needs</li>
<li>teachers fostering children’s ability to follow their interests and build on their strengths</li>
<li>teachers involvement in children’s imaginative and creative play</li>
<li>opportunities for children to revisit their learning and share this with teachers, families and other children through centre displays and individual portfolios.</li>
</ul><p>The environment is well designed to cater for the education and care needs of children. Older children actively explore the interesting spaces prepared by teachers. They follow their curiosity, engage in experimenting and enjoy learning alongside enthusiastic teachers. There is a wide variety of good quality equipment and materials that are easily accessible to children. Children are learning about the natural world and local environment through activities that extend children’s interests and include regular trips and excursions.</p><p>There are many opportunities for children to make choices, problem solve and add complexity to their play. Teachers foster children’s confidence to take leadership in planning and co-constructing their learning with their friends. Good use of information and communication technologies for research is extending children’s interests and knowledge of the wider world.</p><p>The Kidicorp Ltd. ‘Be School Ready’ approach is effectively integrated throughout the curriculum, fostering children’s interests and early skills in literacy and mathematics as they approach school age. Teachers recognise and document the key competencies from <em>The New Zealand Curriculum</em> to support individual children’s transition to school. Parents receive good information from the service about schools in the local area. Teachers have established positive and reciprocal relationships with the new entrant teacher at one school.</p><p>Transitions within the centre are enhanced through opportunities for children to regularly visit with other age groups and explore the learning areas together. Recent self review has resulted in more flexible and responsive routines and transitions for children in the under two area.</p><p>Infants and toddlers up to two years of age are settled, confident and interested in learning through play. Teachers are unhurried in their practice and children are calm and settled.</p><p>An experienced teacher is the consistent caregiver for babies. Infants are cared for in a separate and well-designed area that enables them to watch their peers at play. Their ability to engage in natural movements to promote their growth and development is a particular feature.</p><p>Toddlers are developing their independence, self-care skills and a strong sense of belonging. Teachers know children and their families well and have established a welcoming environment. Parents express appreciation for the care and nurture teachers share with their very young children.</p><p>Knowledge of relevant Māori legends and significant places of local interest is shared with children throughout the centre. This is contributing to Māori tamariki experiencing a curriculum that is increasingly reflective of their language, culture and identity. Māori values are visible in centre displays and some teachers confidently use te reo Māori and include cultural practices in the programme.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre leaders agree that important next steps for development are to review and strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>strategic planning with clearly identified expectations and indicators in relation to strategic goals</li>
<li>embedding bicultural practices through strategic plans and self review</li>
<li>consulting and developing links with tangata whenua</li>
<li>the role of centre leaders in implementing practices reflected in the centre philosophy statements</li>
<li>the documenting of children’s development, progress and engagement in learning</li>
<li>partnership with parents by providing formal opportunities for them to meet with teachers, share their aspirations and be more included in their children’s learning.</li>
</ul><p>In addition, reviewing the transition of new children into the centre is necessary to respond to their individual needs.</p><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends the service accesses appropriate professional learning and development for leaders and teachers to continue to increase their understanding and implementation of te reo Māori and tikanga Māori to promote success for all children.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Topkids Totara Street completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Topkids Totara Street will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>12 December 2013</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here</a>:</p><p><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
