</table><p>The directors and coordinator would benefit from external support to improve management and leadership practices including documenting of health and safety systems. Similarly they need assistance to develop robust operational and management systems to support educators to improve the curriculum for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>This is the first ERO review of Red Robin Homebased Childcare, established in 2014. This home-based network works mostly with nannies and au pairs who come from Germany. A central part of the service’s philosophy is “children learn best in a home environment to flourish, given plenty of attention and time to explore, learn and grow”. Educaters and whānau are encouraged to participate in adult education opportunities.</p><p>The service provides for babies and children up to school age in Auckland. Currently there is one educator and the rest are nannies based mainly in central and west Auckland. Educators work in their own homes to provide education and care for up to four children at any one time. Nannies and au pairs work in the homes of the children. One visiting teacher, who is a qualified and registered early childhood teacher, visits homes and supports educators and nannies to provide educational programmes for children. The service directors are responsible for the overall governance and management of the service.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children's development and learning experiences are recorded in journals that parents are invited to contribute to. These highlight activities children are involved in and aspects of their interests. Educators' learning stories express how children are learning through play. They know the children well. Some stories show children's progress and continuity of learning. The coordinator makes good links of her learning stories to <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum.</p><p>Parents are informed of events and news through monthly newsletters and emails. The directors and coordinator foster strong relationships with families and educators through the regular visits and various forms of open communication they have.</p><p>The management team work well together and are becoming confident with internal evaluation processes. The service's philosophy is well established and reflects centres documents, operations and practices.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The directors and coordinator agree that key next steps to improve the quality of management include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>a process for formal and informal opportunities for parents to communicate with educators and coordinators about their child, and to be involved in decision-making concerning their child’s learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing strategic goals and annual action plan to guide ongoing improvement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evaluating the progress and outcomes of the annual plan</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implementing a new appraisal process and evaluating its effectiveness</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing an effective induction process for new staff and educators.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>They also agree that key next steps for the coordinator include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>documenting coaching and mentoring conversations with educators</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing an effective system of reporting back to directors on the coordinator's work with educators</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensuring that educaters maintain the required health and safety records</p>
</li>
<li>developing a process to show planning assessment and evaluation of children's learning and development.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Red Robin Homebased Childcare completed an <em>ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement</em> and <em>Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to: </p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration. </li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children’s health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>suitable human resource management practices are implemented for educators and staff including a system of regular appraisal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a written child protection policy that meets the requirements of the Vulnerable Children Act 2014</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>effective risk management procedures when children leave the premises for an excursion.</p>
</li>
</ul><p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Licensing Criteria for Home-based Education and Care Services 2008 GMA6, HS28, HS14.</em></p><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Red Robin Homebased Childcare will be within two years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>3 March 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2008</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
