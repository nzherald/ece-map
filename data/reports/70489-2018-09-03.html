</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Twizel Early Learning Centre Inc is a community-based early childhood service licensed for 39 children up to school age, including 12 children under two. Teachers provide education programmes for different aged children in two rooms. Each room has a separate outdoor play area. The centre is located next to Twizel Area School.</p><p>The centre is led by a team made up of the centre manager, two curriculum lead teachers and two teachers. They are supported by a teacher in training, a centre assistant and an office manager.</p><p>The philosophy and vision are underpinned by the early childhood curriculum and strong connections to their children's families and the local community. Valued learning outcomes include children being supported to develop:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strong and trusting relationships</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>belief that their unique contributions are valued</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>independence through having the time and space to grow and develop in a nurturing environment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a strong sense of their culture and identity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>self-confidence and life skills through exploration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Since the last ERO review in 2016, the leaders and teachers developed an action plan to address the recommendations from the report and have made very good progress in addressing these. There have been some changes in the board and centre leadership over this time.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Twizel Early Learning Centre is effectively enabling positive outcomes for children. The centre philosophy, vision and identified learning priorities guide the programme and focus on equitable outcomes for children.</p><p>Teachers provide a responsive curriculum closely aligned with Te Whāriki (the early childhood curriculum) and nurturing, interesting learning environments. They plan using authentic contexts for learning and use children's strengths, needs and interests to engage them in the programme. Children make choices from a wide range of planned activities and resources provided by teachers.</p><p>The bicultural curriculum is visible and consistently integrated into many aspects of teaching, learning and resourcing. This is supporting all children to know about New Zealand's bicultural heritage, and helps Māori children to be proud in their identity.</p><p>The centre provides a range of well-planned and thoughtfully resourced indoor and outdoor environments that meet the needs of children. Teachers have redeveloped the outdoor area to provide more challenge and exploration opportunities for infants and toddlers. Younger children benefit from high teacher ratios and a settled, nurturing environment. Children with additional learning needs are well supported by the collaborative and inclusive culture within the centre.</p><p>Teachers have improved the way they assess and plan programmes for children. They identify children’s individual needs and interests, and plan intentional teaching strategies to meet their learning goals. Leaders have developed systematic processes that support teachers to make regular evaluations of children’s progress.</p><p>Effective leadership now sets a clear direction for teachers. This ensures a consistent approach and is continuing to build the quality of teaching practice. The centre manager is effectively strengthening relationships within and beyond the centre. The board, leaders and teachers value and make use of the contribution of whānau and the local community. These connections are positively contributing to the quality of teaching and learning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the centre leaders agree, that the following next steps are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continue to refine internal evaluation practices, including the use of more purposeful indicators to evaluate the quality and effectiveness of teaching practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>review and refine the centre's philosophy, vision and values to clearly reflect current priorities.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Twizel Early Learning Centre Inc completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Twizel Early Learning Centre Inc will be in three years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review &amp; Improvement Services Southern</p><p><span>Te Waipounamu - Southern Region</span></p><p>3 September 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
