</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kaitaia Playcentre is one of six centres under the guidance of the Far North Playcentre Association, which provides a governance and management framework and ongoing support. The centre is situated adjacent to a local park. It is licensed to provide early education for up to 25 children, including 10 up to the age of two years. It is currently providing two sessions a week for a small group of children and whānau, the majority of whom have Māori heritage. The children all live locally.</p><p>ERO’s 2013 report identified a number of concerns, including low numbers of committed playcentre whānau, a limited focus on children’s learning, and limited understanding and use of self review. The report also urged the Association to increase and sustain enrolments, to ensure that playcentre philosophy was well implemented in practice, and the tailoring of Association support to meet the needs of each centre.</p><p>Since ERO’s 2013 review, the centre has received support from the Playcentre Federation, through a Ministry of Education contract, to improve programme management and self review. Support from a centre operations support person (COS), provided through the Association, will continue for at least two further terms. Association support has focused particularly on increasing membership, building strong relationships amongst families and improving the quality of provision for children’s learning.</p><p>The national playcentre organisation is currently in the process of comprehensive restructure. While this will mean significant changes at the local level, it is expected that support for individual centres will be maintained or strengthened.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of four playcentre reviews in the Far North Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Centre whānau have recently started to improve their outdoor area and to generally improve the environment for children. Some whānau consistently use te reo Māori with their children and the environment also includes recognition of bicultural practice. Some whānau members have supported an Association drive to attract more members to the playcentre.</p><p>The Association’s strategic plan provides a good guide for governance and is regularly monitored. Management and governance processes are well established and are continually refined. The Association continues to consider ways to streamline planning and to monitor its centre support. Association office holders are highly committed to the playcentre philosophy and to maintaining Playcentre as a valuable early childhood education option in the Far North.</p><p>Since the 2013 ERO review, centre numbers have fluctuated and morale in the centre has been low. At present, there is little evidence that most centre whānau follow fundamental playcentre philosophy of operating as a parent cooperative, and learning and playing alongside their children. Most members enjoy the company of the other adults in the centre and the conversations they are able to have. Little time is now spent working with children, or on setting up and preparing for the next session. Centre whānau need to determine whether they are providing a benefit for their children’s learning while they are in the centre.</p><p>Recently, centre whānau and children have been provided with skilled modelling and support from their centre operations support person (COS). However, whānau have not used her modelling to improve their own practices with children and are dependent on her work to maintain sessions.</p><p>Some improvements have occurred over the past two years. These have been the result of the Playcentre Federation, acting under a contract from the Ministry of Education, providing ideas and formats for developing documentation. These improvements, however, are not being sustained.</p><p>Children generally play close to their parents. This is not always conducive to children learning social behaviour with other children. A stronger shared approach to working with all children and developing a shared understanding of acceptable behaviour would benefit this aspect of children’s development.</p><p>ERO and the Association have identified the following concerns relating to the sustainability of Kaitaia Playcentre:</p><ul>
<li>while there is leadership and support from some members, this has been insufficient to generate a stronger membership to ensure the centre’s sustainability</li>
<li>there is little commitment evident in practice of following playcentre philosophy</li>
<li>information and learning from the Federation support has provided guidance for assessment, planning and self review practices. This learning is not being sustained</li>
<li>centre members are not yet capitalising on the modelling by the COS to improve their own practice with children</li>
<li>whānau are not engaging frequently enough in interactions with their children to build vocabulary, or to prompt thinking and ideas for extending their play.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kaitaia Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a</p><p>potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>To improve current practice centre members should:</p><ul>
<li>adequately supervise children while they are playing</li>
<li>monitor sleeping children</li>
<li>ensure that children sit to eat</li>
<li>make the health and safety risk assessment processes more rigorous</li>
<li>revisit policies and procedures with all new members to ensure children’s safety.</li>
</ul><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO found significant areas of non-compliance in the service related to:</p><ul>
<li>the commitment and capacity of families to implement the curriculum and manage the centre effectively in accordance with playcentre philosophy</li>
<li>processes for monitoring practices and ensuring that all legal requirements are met<em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008</em></li>
<li>privacy policy and procedures that ensure children’s families’ and employees’ privacy is protected<em>Privacy Act 1993</em>.</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation to Ministry of Education</h3><p>ERO recommends that the Ministry reassess the licence of Kaitaia Playcentre. ERO will not undertake a further education review of this service until the Ministry of Education is satisfied that the service meets licensing requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kaitaia Playcentre will be in consultation with the Ministry of Education.</p><p>Dale Bailey Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>10 April 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
