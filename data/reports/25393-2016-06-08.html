</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Edukids Apirana is licensed for up to 70 children and serves the culturally and socio-economically diverse communities of Glen Innes and its surrounding suburbs. It offers a pick-up and drop-off van service that supports about 20 local children to participate more regularly in early childhood education. The centre is part of the national BestStart Education and Care Centres organisation, which provides an overarching governance and management framework, as well as personnel, to support individual centres.</p><p>The centre provides for children in three rooms; Kākano for infants and toddlers, Tipu for children who are two to three years old, and Rākau for children up to school age. Infants and toddlers have an outdoor play area, which is separate from that shared by children in the Tipu and Rākau rooms.</p><p>An acting manager and three head teachers provide leadership in the centre and are supported by the BestStart professional services and business managers. Registered teachers in each room are supported by unqualified relief staff and the centre also employs a cook and administrator.</p><p>In 2013 ERO reported that relationships in the well-resourced centre were positive and respectful, and that babies received good care. ERO noted that ongoing staffing challenges had limited centre progress and that teaching practices needed to be more responsive to children's interests. Since 2013, the centre has had several managers who have not stayed long. The teaching teams have worked hard to continue improving their provision for children's learning and to maintain their good relationships with whānau. They have made some progress with improving their assessment and programme planning practices. BestStart managers continue to support the centre and have recently appointed a new centre manager.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Relationships in the service promote children's sense of belonging well, and care routines for babies are appropriately individualised. Teachers listen carefully to children, especially in the Kākano and Tipu rooms. Respectful, one-to-one interactions support children's participation in programme activities. Children play well together and approach adults confidently when they need support.</p><p>Families' cultural backgrounds and languages are included in displays and teachers' commitment to including te reo Māori is also visible. Teachers in Kākano and Rākau have reviewed their bicultural practice, with a view to continual improvement. The head teacher in Tipu also has a goal to increase her team's understanding of <em>Tātaiako: Cultural Competencies for Teachers of Māori Learners</em>, a Ministry of Education resource for supporting cultural responsiveness.</p><p>Indoor play areas are well presented to support children's learning. Displays show children's engagement in the programme and reflect teachers' recent focus on identifying and responding to children's developing dispositions for learning. Teachers' partnerships with whānau are increasingly visible in children's assessment records, particularly since the introduction of an online communication and sharing tool. The service offers parent information evenings, and teachers continue to explore strategies for more regular communications with whānau whose children use the van service.</p><p>Teaching teams have made good progress developing and adjusting processes for programme planning and evaluation. They continue to explore ways to enrich records of children's learning and to refine planning systems so they work well for teachers, children and families.</p><p>Although there have been several changes in centre management, BestStart support and professional development has helped the three head teachers to develop improved understandings of their leadership roles. They are working more collaboratively and are confident to seek support from BestStart managers. There has been a deliberate focus on team building and there is a growing sense of being part of a wider professional family.</p><p>BestStart has useful systems for monitoring service operations. These include regular management meetings and an internal audit process (QEC), which is used to identify challenges and develop plans for improvement. In addition, the centre has a strategic plan that is linked to the BestStart vision and strategic plan, as well as the centre's philosophy statement, an annual management plan and QEC action plans for each room. Teaching teams make good use of templates to review routines, environments and aspects of the programme. They should continue to deepen their reflection about the quality of their teaching practices and increase the rigour and evaluative nature of their self review.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>BestStart managers and head teachers agree that next steps for the service include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continuing to improve children's access to high quality resources and learning environments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>identifying, implementing and evaluating teaching strategies that use older children's individual and shared interests to support more purposeful, complex and extended learning over time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>working with staff to align and simplify the long-term strategic plan, the annual plan and QEC plans</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>refining policies and procedures so they are more readily accessible for whānau and staff</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening centre-wide internal evaluation to support coherence, shared understandings and consistent teaching approaches across the three rooms</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The new manager should continue building collaborative leadership and common teaching approaches across the centre. It would be worthwhile to include all staff, including long-term relievers, in planning for quality improvement.</p><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that BestStart managers continue to work closely with the centre, during the transition to a new centre manager, and to help teachers consolidate and build on recent improvements.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Edukids Apirana completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>administration</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health, safety and welfare</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>personnel management</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>financial and property management.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practices, managers should strengthen links to the Practising Teacher Criteria in teacher appraisal processes.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Edukids Apirana will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>8 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
