</table><p>Rockabye Early Learning Centre is very well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Rockabye Early Learning Centre serves a multi-cultural community and is licensed for 50 children, including up to 15 under two years of age.</p><p>The residential property has been modified and refurbished to provide attractive indoor and outdoor learning areas. Infants and toddlers have their own separate covered and uncovered play spaces. When the children are over two and a half years old, they are transitioned through to the preschool.</p><p>The centre's well-established leadership team comprises the owner/manager, supervisor and professional practice leader, who are all experienced, qualified early childhood teachers.</p><p>The centre's recently reviewed philosophy, values relationships with families and children. It emphasises the importance of families' aspirations and culture. The philosophy acknowledges the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi and the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand. The teaching team recognises and promotes learning through play.</p><p>ERO's 2014 report noted high quality practices in the centre, including consistent and effective teaching, leadership and management, resulting in positive outcomes for children. Next steps, at that time, included enhancing bicultural practices and strategic planning.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from caring, nurturing relationships with teachers. The attractive learning environments are very well resourced and maintained. All children have easy access to indoor and outdoor play areas.</p><p>The curriculum is strongly aligned to <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. Teachers are well supported by leaders to develop responsive programmes appropriate to both age levels. The curriculum is collaboratively developed with input from parents and children. Children are supported to reach their potential through the centre's high quality learning programmes.</p><p>Children play and learn in a respectful environment that provokes them to explore and be curious and engage in imaginative and physical play. Children confidently choose their own learning activities and opportunities that support and challenge them. Teachers acknowledge children as being capable learners and nurture their self-efficacy. Parents and teachers celebrate each child's learning journey with them.</p><p>The language rich environment reflects children's diverse cultures and successfully supports children to feel included. Teachers respond well to children's cultures, abilities and needs, and include aspects of their home languages. Teachers engage in conversations that encourage each child's language development.</p><p>Leaders and teachers have comprehensive knowledge of children. Individual portfolios contain high quality learning stories that celebrate and share each child's learning journey.</p><p>The experienced and well qualified leadership team works collaboratively to lead the centre. There is a strong commitment to staff wellbeing. Staff benefit from ongoing high quality professional support and learning. A culture of mutual trust, collaboration and shared purpose is evident amongst staff.</p><p>The centre's vision, philosophy and values are well documented and highly visible in centre operations. Good quality strategic and annual plans inform the centre's future direction. The robust, inclusive and research-informed evaluation processes are focused on continuously enhancing outcomes for all children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Next steps for the leadership and teaching teams are to continue refining ways of monitoring progress towards strategic goals, and evaluating the impact of developments on outcomes for children.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Rockabye Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>18 April 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
