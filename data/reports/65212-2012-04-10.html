<a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2>
<p>Murchison Playcentre is one of 14 parent-led centres operating under the umbrella of the Nelson Playcentres Association (the association). Strategic and policy direction for centre operations is provided by association personnel. The association office administrator undertakes the role of the licensee.</p>
<p>Each morning the playcentre provides sessional education and care for children from birth to school age in a mixed-age setting. Parents/caregivers run the playcentre and education programme.</p>
<p>The playcentre, located on the local school grounds, is the only early childhood centre in the district. Roll numbers have remained stable.</p>
<p>A well-resourced and spacious learning environment provides children with a rich range of creative learning opportunities in all curriculum areas. Environments are organised to cater for children of all ages.</p>
<p>Session team members respond positively to children's individual needs. Children are confident with familiar and unhurried routines. They are able to choose from a wide range of activities, including some centred on using natural resources. Children enjoy opportunities to be involved in social interactions and conversations with other children, their parents and team members. Literacy and mathematics are naturally included in children’s play. Child-initiated play is valued.</p>
<p>Since ERO’s 2007 review the centre has made improvements and strengthened practices relating to safety and assessment procedures. Session team members are continuing to develop their confidence in using te reo Māori with the children and recognise that this is an area for ongoing development.</p>
<p>This report identifies the need for further property development, assessment and a more structured self-review process.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p>
<a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2>
<h3>The Focus of the Review</h3>
<p>Before the review, the management of Murchison Playcentre was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p>
<p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children at Murchison Playcentre.</p>
<p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p>
<ul><li>the learning environment;</li>
<li>the programme provided for children; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><h3>The Quality of Education</h3>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>The Murchison Playcentre is the only early childhood education facility in the area and supports a number of rural, isolated families. Many of the families are transient, resulting in a small number of longer-serving parents maintaining continuing responsibility for the centre. The centre is located on the local school site and the property is the school’s responsibility.</p>
<p>Since the 2007 ERO review the parents have developed a garden and have upgraded the boundary fence. A recently constructed veranda improves the indoor/outdoor flow.</p>
<h4>Learning Environment</h4>
<p>The stimulating, well-resourced learning environment is carefully set up and organised to provide a wide range of experiences. Children enjoy the spacious playground, which encourages active play either by themselves or alongside others. There is a busy tone to sessions.</p>
<p>Parent participation is supported by a dedicated adult space, furniture and resources.</p>
<p>The supervision group recognises that sometimes the noise level inside can be too loud and is considering ways to improve the acoustics.</p>
<h4>Programme</h4>
<p>The playcentre philosophy of parents as educators is reflected in the quality of education and care children experience. The family is valued and supported as the key setting for nurture and education. The centre provides 16 areas of play from which emerges a child-initiated programme.</p>
<p>Programmes are designed around children’s emerging interests and parents’ contributions and ideas. They are thoughtfully planned. As a result of daily review, planning for subsequent sessions continues to be responsive to children’s play.</p>
<p>Children benefit from a wide range of play and learning opportunities. Aspects of literacy, mathematics, and some te reo Māori are integrated into the daily programme. Continuing to work on development of bicultural perspectives and practices should build well on work done in this area since the previous ERO review. In the context of play, session team members see and create opportunities to encourage thinking, science learning, exploration, experimentation and investigation. Excursions are well planned and attended by parents.</p>
<p>The team works hard to develop and maintain children’s portfolios. These provide a range of information about participation in centre life and are valued by parents. The team recognises that there are still improvements to be made. For example:</p>
<ul><li>sharing the purpose more clearly</li>
<li>including more learning stories about the individual to show his/her interests and talents</li>
<li>increasing parent input into the portfolios through contributing to assessment of their child’s learning</li>
<li>emphasising children’s strengths and interests.</li>
</ul><p>The supervision team and ERO have identified the need for members to familiarise themselves with current playcentre and Ministry of Education guidelines and procedures for self review.</p>
<p>The playcentre runs a valuable programme for four-year-olds to facilitate their smooth transition into the local school. There is a strong relationship between the school and the centre.</p>
<h4>Interactions</h4>
<p>Affirming and reciprocal interactions and relationships are evident between adults and children. Session team members provide good models to support positive social and emotional competence. They are attuned to children’s interests and needs, and skilled at fostering and promoting their independence, confidence, friendships and learning. Children readily approach adults who respond to all children as capable and competent learners.</p>
<h4>Centre management</h4>
<p>The appraisal of paid staff is managed by the association. The peer-review process has not proved to be sufficiently robust nor developmental. The association should review the process to better support its paid staff.</p>
<a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2>
<p>Before the review, the staff of Murchison Playcentre completed an ERO <em>Centre Assurance Statement</em> and <em>Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>During the course of the review ERO identified areas of non-compliance.</p>
<p>The team members relocated some learning areas during the summer break. As a result, earthquake proofing was overlooked. Several structures need to be secured.</p>
<p>The condition of the kitchen is unacceptable. It has not been maintained and is unhygienic. Immediate steps should be taken to upgrade this part of the centre.</p>
<p>In order to address these, centre managers must meet the following regulatory requirements:</p>
<div><ol><li>The licensee of a licensed centre must ensure that the centre has adequate provision for protection against earthquake damage. <em>[R24 (4) and 23 (2) Education (Early Childhood Centres) Regulations, 1998]</em></li>
<li>Every person responsible for the control of a centre, every staff member of a centre and the licensee of a centre must ensure that, so far as is reasonably practicable, hazards to the safety of the children are corrected, repaired, removed, or made inaccessible to the children. <em>[R24 (4) Education (Early Childhood Centres) Regulations, 1998]</em></li>
<li>The licensee of a licensed centre must ensure that (a) It is equipped with adequate and suitable kitchen facilities (b) Its staff have access to adequate and reasonable kitchen facilities. <em>[R18, R19, R20 Education (ECC) Regulations 1998 1–5 Second Schedule Education (ECC) Regulations 1998]</em></li>
</ol></div>
<a id="4-recommendations" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Recommendations</h2>
<p>ERO and the centre managers agree that the following are areas for review and development:</p>
<ul><li>self review</li>
<li>bicultural perspectives and practices</li>
<li>the quality of information recorded in children’s portfolios</li>
<li>the level of noise indoors</li>
<li>parent involvement in planning for their child’s learning</li>
<li>the implementation of developmental appraisals.</li>
</ul><a id="5-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5. Future Action</h2>
<p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p>

<p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office’s latest report on Murchison Playcentre.</p>
<p>Murchison Playcentre is one of 14 parent-led centres operating under the umbrella of the Nelson Playcentres Association (the association). Strategic and policy direction for centre operations is provided by association personnel. The association office administrator undertakes the role of the licensee.</p>
<p>Each morning the playcentre provides sessional education and care for children from birth to school age in a mixed-age setting. Parents/caregivers run the playcentre and education programme.</p>
<p>The playcentre, located on the local school grounds, is the only early childhood centre in the district. Roll numbers have remained stable.</p>
<p>A well-resourced and spacious learning environment provides children with a rich range of creative learning opportunities in all curriculum areas. Environments are organised to cater for children of all ages.</p>
<p>Session team members respond positively to children's individual needs. Children are confident with familiar and unhurried routines. They are able to choose from a wide range of activities, including some centred on using natural resources. Children enjoy opportunities to be involved in social interactions and conversations with other children, their parents and team members. Literacy and mathematics are naturally included in children’s play. Child-initiated play is valued.</p>
<p>Since the last review the centre has made improvements and strengthened practices relating to safety and assessment procedures. Session team members are continuing to develop their confidence in using te reo with the children and recognise that this is an area for ongoing development.</p>
<p>This report identifies the need for further property development, assessment and a more structured self-review process.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p>
<p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p>
<p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p>

<h3>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h3>
<h4>About ERO</h4>
<p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p>
<h4>About ERO Reviews</h4>
<p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p>
<ul><li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre’s self review.</p>
<h4>Review Focus</h4>
<p>ERO’s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Quality of Education</strong> – including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Review Priorities</strong> – other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><strong>National Evaluation Topics</strong> – This strand contributes to the development of education policies and their effective implementation. The information from this strand is aggregated by ERO for its national evaluation reports. Topics for investigation are changed regularly to provide up-to-date information.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance with Legal Requirements</strong> – assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h4>Review Coverage</h4>
<p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p>
<h4>Review Recommendations</h4>
<p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p>
