</table><p>Eden/Epsom Playcentre is very well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Eden/Epsom Playcentre is a well-established centre and is run as a parent cooperative. It is open for five sessions each week and provides for an increasingly culturally diverse community. Many children remain at the centre until they transition to school.</p><p>Centre practices are based on the Playcentre philosophy of families learning together. The centre's philosophy affirms parents as valued and best educators of their children. Sessions are guided by <span lang="mi"><em>Te Whāriki</em>,</span> the early childhood curriculum, and a commitment to <span lang="mi">Te Tiriti o Waitangi.</span></p><p>The centre has a positive ERO reporting history. Since the 2015 ERO report, centre members have sustained good practices. They responded well to the key next steps identified in the 2015 report, such as strengthening transition to school practices. Good adult education levels have been sustained. Currently six members have completed a Course 3 qualification, and most members are enrolled in the new Playcentre courses.</p><p>The new Playcentre Aotearoa structure is now fully operational. It provides a sound management framework and support personnel to help parents/whānau to manage their centres. Playcentre Aotearoa administers centres’ funding and provides adult education programmes for parents/whānau to achieve Playcentre qualifications.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of six reviews in the Playcentre Aotearoa Auckland region.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children experience a calm and settled environment. They are highly engaged in meaningful, sustained and purposeful play. Children enjoy a wide variety of learning experiences that encourage them to be confident, creative, and physically active. They have opportunities to explore and investigate the well-resourced environment and spacious outdoor area.</p><p>Parents/whānau value child-initiated play. Children are encouraged to be creative and imaginative. Interactions between adults and children are sensitive and supportive of children's learning. Adults take time to listen to children and encourage them to take responsibility for the wellbeing of themselves, others and their environment.</p><p>Parents/whānau provide a play-based curriculum that responds very effectively to the curiosities, strengths and abilities of all children. All parents/whānau contribute to programme planning. Children's portfolios are well presented, individual and informative. Newer centre members are well supported to build their knowledge and understanding about recording children’s learning and to build their capability in planning, assessment and evaluation of learning.</p><p>Centre members' commitment to embedding <span lang="mi">te reo</span> and <span lang="mi">te ao Māori</span> in the programme is evident. Members are continuing to build their knowledge, capability and confidence in bicultural practices.</p><p>Highly effective systems for fostering emergent leadership are well established and understood. Members work collaboratively to promote a high level of engagement in their children's learning and centre operations. Well-considered systems and processes and regular open communications support members to implement high quality practices.</p><p>Centre members have adopted planned approaches to implementing the Playcentre <span lang="mi">Aotearoa</span> policy framework. The strategic plan, annual plan and <span lang="mi"><em>Te Whāriki</em></span> guide the future direction of the centre. Internal evaluation is focused on positive outcomes for children and the ongoing sustainability of the centre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre members have identified appropriate next steps to enhance existing quality practices, including:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continuing to strengthen <span lang="mi">te reo and tikanga Māori</span> in the programme and environment.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Key next steps for development in the Playcentre <span lang="mi">Aotearoa</span> Auckland region include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthening the use of internal evaluation to measure the effectiveness of systems and practices across the region.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Eden/Epsom Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services (Northern)</p><p>Northern Region - <span lang="mi">Te Tai Raki</span></p><p>3 June 2020</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout <span lang="mi">Aotearoa</span> New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework <span lang="mi">Ngā Pou Here</span> is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup><col> <col> <col> </colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and <span lang="mi">Ngā Pou Here</span> refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
