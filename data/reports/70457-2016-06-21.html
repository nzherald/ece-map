</table><p>The centre is Well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Cotswold Preschool and Nursery is a small community-based early childhood education (ECE) centre that has been operating for almost 50 years. Children and families experience a welcoming and caring service that encourages close relationships between the centre, the child and the family. An elected committee of parents is responsible for the governance of the centre.</p><p>An increasing number of children come from diverse cultural backgrounds. This is reflected in the profile of the centre staffing.</p><p>The centre is involved with a group of local ECE centres and schools working together to improve educational outcomes for children. Transitions into, within the centre and to school have benefitted from the collaborative work.</p><p>The centre has made some progress in addressing the recommendations from the 2013 ERO Report in self review, planning and assessment. Further development is required in strategic planning and appraisal. These are identified within the report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children learn in spacious, well-presented and well-resourced environments. They have an opportunity to direct their own learning by asking teachers to set up activities and resources that match their interests, needs and passions. The outdoor environment provides for fun, physical challenge and creativity.</p><p>Infants and toddlers learn through uninterrupted play in an attractive environment. Routines are unhurried and in line with routines at home. Children are acknowledged as individuals through close responsive relationships with the nursery teachers.</p><p>Relationships are positive and respectful among children and with adults. Children play well together and support each other in their learning. There is an inclusive culture with the many ethnicities of children and staff reflected in the environment and celebrations. Children with special and educational needs are well supported by teachers and parents in conjunction with outside agencies.</p><p>The centre philosophy of increased children’s self choice in their learning, a focus on strengthening and extending children’s interests is embedded in centre practice. There is a broad range of curriculum opportunities to capture and extend on children’s interests. Children have many opportunities to learn about healthy eating and sustainable practices and to extend their physical capabilities through play.</p><p>Teachers make purposeful use of team observations of children at play to plan interesting programmes that build on children’s knowledge and understanding. Parents receive useful information in learning stories and assessments to show the progress children are making in their learning. Links to home experiences are reflected in the learning opportunities in the centre.</p><p>Aspects of the environment reflect bicultural New Zealand. The centre has engaged with the local marae to further their understanding and knowledge of te ao Māori.</p><p>Managers are increasingly encouraging teachers to take responsibility for aspects of the operation of the centre. The centre is part of a collaboration of community-based ECEs that provide support to leaders and teachers to its improve their practice. Self review is supporting the centre to make well considered improvements to centre and teacher practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre has identified, and ERO agrees, the next steps to further improve outcomes for children include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>seeking support to assist with the development of robust policies and procedures related to new legislation that has an important impact on appointments, child protection and hazard remediation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improving evaluation of whole-centre planning to include what impact the programme has had on children’s learning, and what teachers could do to improve practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>clarifying centre expectations to ensure staff and children have opportunities to learn about and through the unique language, culture and identity of Aotearoa New Zealand</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implementing and embedding the newly adopted appraisal system</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening strategic and annual planning.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Cotswold Preschool and Nursery completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Cotswold Preschool and Nursery will be in three years.</p><p>Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern</p><p>21 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
