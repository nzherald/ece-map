</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The Symonds Street Early Childhood Centre is one of six licensed centres operated by the University of Auckland. The centre is well positioned in relation to the campus, providing flexible services for children of staff and students from the university.</p><p>Children attending the centre are between two and five years of age. Most children transition into this centre from the nearby infant and toddler centre. It operates under the same management and leadership team and has some of the same teachers.</p><p>The University of Auckland is the licensee and the person responsible is the new centre manager who was appointed in 2014. Some teachers have had a long association with the centre. Recently appointed staff include a new centre leader and a head teacher.</p><p>ERO’s 2012 report acknowledged the friendly and inclusive culture underpinning the child-focused programme. The report also identified several areas for further development and the new leadership and management team are taking positive steps to address these.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their families are welcomed into the centre. They have diverse cultural backgrounds and several have home languages other than English. Children are well supported to make friends and quickly develop a sense of belonging.</p><p>Children are considered to be capable and competent learners and are able to make decisions about their play. They have extended periods of uninterrupted play. This allows them to persist with activities in groups and individually. Relationships between children and teachers are respectful and inclusive.</p><p>Many of the positive care and education practices identified in the 2102 ERO report are still evident. The learning programme is clearly aligned to <em>Te Whāriki,</em> early childhood curriculum and is well resourced. The free flowing and relaxed tone of the centre enables children to engage in purposeful learning and socialising activities.</p><p>Children enjoy the programme and are confident to ask teachers for support. Many teachers engage children in interactions and conversations that extend children’s interests and ideas. Teachers are exploring different ways to organise the learning environment so that children can use and return to resources more independently.</p><p>Centre staff are currently reviewing many of their existing operations. The new manager and centre leaders are consulting teachers and parents as they review policies, develop plans and evaluate practices. Changes are being well communicated and shared with families and children.</p><p>New systems have been introduced to support children to become more self managing. Children can make decisions about their play and when they having morning tea. Lunch is now provided by a catering service. Bi-cultural practices are evident in resources, at group times, meal times and in planned cultural events. Teachers should continue to make te reo and tikanga Māori more visible throughout the programme.</p><p>Greater use is being made of digital technologies. Children can use i-Pads to photograph and video their learning activities. Teachers assist children to access information via the internet. Parents have welcomed the centres’ new digital communication system that enables their child’s progress and interests to be more easily shared with them.</p><p>Professional learning and development is planned so that teachers can continue to improve the way they evaluate outcomes for children. New approaches to planning and assessment will allow teachers to better recognise and respond to children’s interests and developments. Centre leaders agree that teachers could do more to increase the engagement and levels of challenge for older children.</p><p>Long term plans and goals have been developed to guide centre improvements. Goals are shared with staff and built into appraisal systems to embed new directions. Teachers are benefitting from the new centre leadership and opportunities to contribute to self review and centre-wide improvement.</p><p>ERO is confident that the new centre managers have the expertise and experience to lift the quality of the services through consistent leadership and ongoing self review.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre managers have identified useful next steps to continue centre development. Their priorities include:</p><ul>
<li>using the centre philosophy as a focus for self review and evaluating practice</li>
<li>strengthening the use of children’s learning dispositions in planning and assessment</li>
<li>evaluating the impact of goals and plans to promote bicultural practices</li>
<li>formalising transition practices, particularly from the centre for children under two years of age.</li>
</ul><p>ERO agrees these are well-selected goals. In addition, ERO would encourage centre managers to continue evaluating how effectively the current individual learning portfolios document children’s progress and development.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Symonds Street Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Symonds Street Early Childhood Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>29 May 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
