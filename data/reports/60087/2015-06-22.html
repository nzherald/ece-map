</tr></tbody></table><p>With ongoing targeted support from the association, Island Bay Kindergarten is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p>
<p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Island Bay Kindergarten is one of 85 kindergartens and three home-based education and care networks governed and managed by He Whānau Manaaki o Tararua Free Kindergarten Association Incorporated (the association). This is a new kindergarten association created from joining the Rimutaka and Wellington Kindergarten Associations in 2014. The transition to the new association is expected to be a three-year process.</p>
<p>The board and managers provide governance for the organisation. Senior teachers have delegated kindergartens. Their role is to provide regular support and a range of professional learning and development opportunities for teachers. A new senior teacher has recently been appointed to Island Bay Kindergarten.</p>
<p>In 2012, the association developed a framework to guide the implementation of its curriculum, Te Manawa.This document outlines criteria for curriculum delivery including expectations for assessment and planning for children’s learning.</p>
<p>The December 2011 ERO report for Island Bay Kindergarten identified areas that needed further development. The outdoor environment and teachers’ use of purposeful conversations promoting learning have been addressed. The bicultural curriculum, self review and assessment practices continue to need further development.</p>
<p>Areas where the Wellington Kindergarten Association needed to strengthen its support for teachers were also identified at the time. Improvement continues to be needed in some of these areas that the association has plans to address. These feature as key next steps in this report. The alignment of individual kindergartens' annual plans with the association’s strategic priorities has now been appropriately addressed.</p>
<p>Since the previous ERO review, the two separate licences making up Island Bay Kindergarten have been combined. This merger includes the teaching teams. Hours of operation have changed and a mixed-age programme operates daily. A playgroup is offered within the morning session from Monday to Thursday.</p>
<p>This review was part of a cluster of 16 reviews in the He Whānau Manaaki o Tararua kindergartens.</p>
<h3>The Review Findings</h3>
<p>The kindergarten needs to undertake significant work to further implement its curriculum effectively. ERO has confidence that with the support of the senior teacher and the association, staff are well placed to make the necessary improvements.</p>
<p>Aspects of the philosophy are evident in practice. The implementation of Te Manawa should be further strengthened to enable teachers at Island Bay Kindergarten to respond to and promote successful outcomes for all children. The merging of the two licences has led to some operational decisions which are not yet effectively supporting all children’s learning. It is timely now to review the present programme to enhance children's learning opportunities.</p>
<p>Assessment, planning and evaluation practices have improved since the previous ERO review. They now require further strengthening to support greater consistency amongst teachers in capturing and responding to children’s cultures, interests and previous learning.</p>
<p>Self review for improvement has developed since the previous ERO review. It has become embedded practice and led to some positive changes in the kindergarten. A new process has recently been introduced. This has increased staff participation and ownership. Teachers have identified they need to continue to strengthen this new process. ERO‘s evaluation affirms this ongoing focus.</p>
<p>Children at Island Bay Kindergarten have some opportunities to learn about Aotearoa New Zealand’s dual cultural heritage. A key next step is for teachers to seek support from the association to further develop the bicultural curriculum. This was an area for development in the previous ERO report.</p>
<p>Association leaders acknowledge that they need to build teachers’ capability to be responsive to Māori children’s culture, language and identity. This development should include establishing relationships with mana whenua and making use of Ministry of Education resources such as, <em>Ka Hikitia - Accelerating Success 2013 - 2017</em> and <em>Tātaiako: Cultural Competencies for Teachers of Māori Learners.</em></p>
<p>ERO observed teachers using some effective practices to engage children in the programme. Established links with local schools have been sustained and help to promote experiences that assist children and their families as they move on to school. Children show independence and care and concern for one another.</p>
<p>The senior teacher provides termly written reports that outline agreed development priorities and progress in relation to the quality of teaching and learning. The association has recently implemented new reports that should more deliberately focus on outcomes for children, teacher and leader performance. ERO's evaluation affirms this development.</p>
<p>The previous ERO report identified that the association needed to improve the appraisal process. This continues to require strengthening. A recently revised appraisal model, yet to be implemented, includes: more focused goals that build teacher and leader capability; more regular and targeted feedback and feed forward about teaching practice; and clearer links with the Registered Teacher Criteria.</p>
<h3>Key Next Steps</h3>
<p>The senior teacher, head teacher and staff should strengthen the implementation of Te Manawa by:</p>
<ul><li>reviewing curriculum effectiveness, including methods of delivery</li>
<li>further developing the bicultural curriculum</li>
<li>strengthening assessment, planning and evaluation of children’s learning</li>
<li>strengthening self review.</li>
</ul><p>The senior management team of He Whānau Manaaki o Tararua should continue to further improve processes for growing and developing the practice of teachers, head teachers and senior teachers. These should include:</p>
<ul><li>improvements to the quality and monitoring of processes to support individual kindergartens and regular implementation of a robust appraisal system</li>
<li>building teachers’ capability to be responsive to Māori children’s culture, language and identity.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3>
<p>Before the review, the staff and management of Island Bay Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p>
<p>Since the on-site phase of the review, the kindergarten has addressed concerns ERO had about documentation related to accidents to children and fire and earthquake drills. The service provider must ensure that these recent improvements to practice are maintained.</p>
<h3>Next ERO Review</h3>
<h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4>
<p>The next ERO review of Island Bay Kindergarten will be in three years.</p>

<h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3>
<p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p>

<h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3>
<p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework<a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/"> Ngā Pou Here:</a></p>
<ul><li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p>
<p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p>
<p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p>
<p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p>
<h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3>
<p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p>
<ul><li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO’s website</a>.</p>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
