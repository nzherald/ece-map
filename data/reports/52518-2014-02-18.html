</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Montessori Educare Ltd is a privately owned centre licensed for full-day sessions for up to 50 children aged 2 to 6 years. The building comprises two, purpose-designed classrooms, an administrative area and has a spacious outdoor area.</p><p>The owner is supported in the running of the centre by the administration manager and the centre’s team leader. A qualified staff of five teachers lead the sessions. Centre management and teachers work collaboratively to promote the Montessori philosophy and principles of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. These are evident in the daily operation of the centre.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children enjoy frequent opportunities to explore their own interests within a structured and responsive programme. They are highly engaged in learning, both independently and alongside others. Their interests, skill and attitude development are catered for through group experiences or self-chosen activities. Individuals are supported to learn within a programme that flows smoothly and at an unhurried pace.</p><p>The learning environment is well resourced. Routines are flexible and children are supported in caring and nurturing ways. Children display respect for themselves, others and their surroundings. The programme emphasises developing and extending children’s literacy and numeracy skills.</p><p>A collective approach to children’s engagement and learning is evident. Teachers recognise and plan for children's emerging interests and ideas. They meet regularly to share observations of individual children and reflect on their learning across the curriculum areas. Teachers plan collaboratively and share this planning with families. Parents regularly contribute to the programme through sharing their interests, skills and cultures.</p><p>Parents are provided with regular information about their children’s progress. Assessment profiles are attractive and informative. They include observations of children and their learning, and records of enrichment events. Parents have an attractive record of the range of their child’s experiences. Children and parents have ready access to these books. In addition, parents have an opportunity to discuss their children’s learning at twice-yearly parent-teacher interviews.</p><p>Teachers show growing confidence in promoting te reo me ngā tikanga Māori. Teachers regularly use te reo Māori in their interactions with children and adults. This is identified for continuing development.</p><p>Centre policies, curriculum and practice uphold cultural awareness and responsiveness. There is regular recognition of the cultural richness children and their families bring to the community.</p><p>All children and families are assisted to make the move to school. Children are able to return to the centre for a school holiday programme. Feedback from past families and children indicates that children make the transition easily and settle well into their new environments.</p><p>Centre operation is highly inclusive and collaborative. Quality relationships are evident among the manager, teachers, administrator, children and parents. The team leader promotes teamwork and encourages others to initiate and lead activities. Professional learning is appropriately budgeted for and valued. Administration is efficient and complements the work of the teaching team.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Regular reflection and self review are effective in identifying the centre’s priorities. The next steps are to develop and implement:</p><ul>
<li>a strategic plan that identifies priorities, steps to address these and links these to the annual plan and professional learning opportunities</li>
<li>a revised appraisal system to support ongoing professional growth.</li>
</ul><p>ERO agrees with these priorities and has also identified a need to further develop the evaluation of programmes.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Montessori Educare Ltd completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Montessori Educare Ltd will be in three years.<img title="" src="assets/index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" alt=""></p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region (Acting)</p><p>18 February 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
