<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2 align="left">1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">Wairaka Playcentre is a parent-led cooperative, early childhood education and care service for children from birth to school age. The centre is located near the Wairaka Marae and the Whakatane central business district. It operates under the governance of the Eastern Bay of Plenty Playcentre Association.</p><p align="left">At the time of this review 18 children were enrolled, six of whom identified as being of M&#257;ori descent. Increasing the centre&rsquo;s bicultural dimension is an ongoing focus for centre members. They have accessed positive support from a Rural Education Activities Programme (REAP) advisor and this is enhancing their confidence to use te reo M&#257;ori with children and each other.</p><p align="left">Parents are highly committed to implementing the playcentre philosophy of promoting child-initiated play in an inviting and fun environment. They work hard to ensure that all areas of play are well resourced and attractively presented.</p><p align="left">Adults respond to children&rsquo;s interests and extend these through planned centre activities and outings. They talk with children, and model good quality oral language and listening skills. There are many opportunities for children to experiment with literacy, science and mathematics. They are free to persevere and solve problems independently in a safe and caring environment.</p><p align="left">Positive and respectful relationships among parents and between children and adults are a feature of the centre. The centre president, supported by a small group of committed parents, is working hard to retain the playcentre service. This group acknowledges the need to raise the profile of playcentre in the community and to attract and retain new families so that the centre can be sustained.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of Playcentre was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atPlaycentre.</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">Since ERO&rsquo;s last review in October 2008 there have been considerable changes in centre membership. The loss of experienced members and shortage of families and children is presenting a significant challenge to this parent-led, early childhood education service. The playcentre philosophy is based on core values of a family-based cooperative run by committed and educated parents. The philosophy also promotes:</p><ul>
<li>a mixed age range where individual needs are met;</li>
<li>child-initiated and self-chosen play in a bicultural setting;</li>
<li>fun in a wide range of play areas; and</li>
<li>a minimum ratio of one adult to every five children.</li>
</ul><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p align="left"><b>Relationships and interactions:</b> Positive, respectful and reciprocal relationships at all levels are a feature of the centre. These relationships are characterised by:</p><ul>
<li>adults responding to, and caring for, their own and other children;</li>
<li>high levels of cooperation where parents model positive social skills, including concepts such as sharing and turn taking;</li>
<li>interactions that value children&rsquo;s and adults&rsquo; ideas and preferences; and</li>
<li>open communication and collaboration.</li>
</ul><p align="left"><b>Learning opportunities</b></p><p align="left">Parents are committed to implementing the playcentre philosophy of promoting child-initiated play in an inviting and fun environment. They work hard to ensure that all areas of play are well resourced and presented in a manner that fosters children&rsquo;s curiosity and exploration.</p><p align="left">Adults notice and respond to children&rsquo;s emerging interests and extend these interests and ideas through planned activities and experiences. They engage children in conversations about their play and model good quality oral language and listening skills.</p><p align="left">There are extensive opportunities for children to experiment with literacy, science and mathematics in the meaningful context of play. They are free to set their own challenges and persevere to solve problems independently. Children enjoy being creative and expressive through art, music, singing and dance.</p><p align="left">These learning opportunities are contributing to the ways in which children view themselves as capable and confident communicators and learners.</p><p align="left"><b>Self review:</b> ERO&rsquo;s previous review acknowledged self review as a significant strength. The playcentre continues to embed well-developed self-review practices. Members have also used ERO&rsquo;s previous evaluation as the basis for action plans, which provide a clear framework to guide centre improvement and direction.</p><h4>Agreed priority for development and review</h4><p align="left"><b>Centre sustainability:</b> Centre members, with support from the association, acknowledge the need to raise the profile of playcentre in the community and to attract and retain new families. In addition, implementing strategies to streamline administration roles and responsibilities should assist centre members to strengthen their focus on parent education, the quality of sessions, assessment, planning and evaluation.</p><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. National Evaluation Topic</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p align="left">ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h3>Partnerships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children in early childhood services</h3><p align="left">As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p><ul>
<li>this service understands and values the identity, language and culture of M&#257;ori children and their wh&#257;nau, particularly when the child and wh&#257;nau transition to the service;</li>
<li>managers and educators have built relationships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children; and</li>
<li>this service works in partnership with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children.</li>
</ul><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">At the time of this review 18 children were enrolled, six of whom identified as being of M&#257;ori descent. ERO&rsquo;s last review identified the need to improve the M&#257;ori dimension within the centre environment and programme. Increasing the centre&rsquo;s bicultural dimension has been an ongoing focus for members, with support from the association.</p><h4>Area of strength</h4><p align="left"><b>Te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori:</b> Adults and children are benefiting from the support and mentoring of a specialist adviser who fosters the inclusion of te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori in the centre. Her regular participation in sessions is enhancing parents&rsquo; confidence and capability to use te reo M&#257;ori with children. A feature of this support is the spontaneous and natural approach to promoting learning about tikanga and te reo M&#257;ori. M&#257;ori children and parents are confident that their language and culture is valued by their peers in the centre.</p><a id="4-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Playcentre completed an ERO Centre Management Assurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they have attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><a id="5-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5. Future Action</h2><p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children.

</table><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-playcentre" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Playcentre</h2><p align="left">These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Playcentre.</p><p align="left">Wairaka Playcentre is a parent-led cooperative, early childhood education and care service for children from birth to school age. The centre is located near the Wairaka Marae and the Whakatane central business district. It operates under the governance of the Eastern Bay of Plenty Playcentre Association.</p><p align="left">At the time of this review 18 children were enrolled, six of whom identified as being of M&#257;ori descent. Increasing the centre&rsquo;s bicultural dimension is an ongoing focus for centre members. They have accessed positive support from a Rural Education Activities Programme (REAP) advisor and this is enhancing their confidence to use te reo M&#257;ori with children and each other.</p><p align="left">Parents are highly committed to implementing the playcentre philosophy of promoting child-initiated play in an inviting and fun environment. They work hard to ensure that all areas of play are well resourced and attractively presented.</p><p align="left">Adults respond to children&rsquo;s interests and extend these through planned centre activities and outings. They talk with children, and model good quality oral language and listening skills. There are many opportunities for children to experiment with literacy, science and mathematics. They are free to persevere and solve problems independently in a safe and caring environment.</p><p align="left">Positive and respectful relationships among parents and between children and adults are a feature of the centre. The centre president, supported by a small group of committed parents, is working hard to retain the playcentre service. This group acknowledges the need to raise the profile of playcentre in the community and to attract and retain new families so that the centre can be sustained.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p align="left">If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p align="left">Richard Thornton</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Northern Region</p></html>
