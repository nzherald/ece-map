</table><p>Kindercare Learning Centres - Thomas Road is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kindercare Learning Centres - Thomas Road is located in the suburb of Rototuna in the north east of Hamilton. The centre is owned by Kindercare Ltd who operate many early childhood centres throughout New Zealand. The centre is licensed to provide education and care for 100 children including 25 aged under two years. It operates a full-day programme in five age-based rooms. At the time of this review the centre's multicultural roll of 105 included 39 children identified as Chinese and 19 of Māori descent.</p><p>A centre director provides overall professional leadership and is supported by a supervisor who has responsibility for curriculum programmes and the team leaders. A Kindercare area manager supports leaders in all areas of centre operations.</p><p>Since the previous ERO review in 2014, a new centre director has been appointed and there have been many changes to the teaching team. The centre has responded well to addressing the key next step identified in the 2014 ERO report about strengthening culturally responsive practice and assessment processes.</p><p>The centre's philosophy makes a commitment to keeping children safe, loved and learning. An emphasis is placed on providing learning programmes that focus on children following their own interests, building meaningful relationships with adults and being valued as uniquely special.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children enjoy participating in a programme that effectively supports their care and learning. The programme is a combination of teacher-led and child-initiated activities. Literacy and mathematics are naturally integrated into children's play. Children over the age of three enjoy opportunities to undertake visits and trips into the wider community. A special strength is the highly inclusive approach to supporting children with high learning and care needs. Children up to the age of two years benefit from caring and nurturing relationships with their teachers. The close relationship between parents and teachers supports a sense of wellbeing and belonging for babies and very young children.</p><p>Māori children's culture, language and identity are acknowledged through celebrations of special events, regular waiata, karakia, and some teacher's use of te reo Māori. A meaningful relationship with whānau is supporting the centre to develop stronger links with local marae.</p><p>Children's learning and development is well documented and easily accessible to parents in an electronic format. Some teachers make good use of this information to extend children's learning and emerging interests. The centre should now give consideration to ensuring this information is readily available for children to revisit their learning.</p><p>Teachers work collegially in the best interests of children and their families. They have developed effective parent partnerships to gain insight into the aspirations they have for their children. This information is effectively used to respond to children's care needs and to extend their home interests. Teachers have positive and affirming relationships with children and their families. ERO observed effective teaching practices where teachers extended children's language and problem solving skills through meaningful play. In some areas of the centre greater flexibility in routines would enable children to persist with their play. Developing the consistency of teaching practice is a key next step for the centre. Teachers with Chinese and Indian heritage support their colleagues to respond effectively to children from diverse cultural backgrounds. Responsive teaching contributes to meeting the centre's commitment to valuing each child as uniquely special.</p><p>Centre leadership is knowledgeable and well informed. The recently appointed centre director is highly respected by teachers and has a very strong relationship with children and their families. She is well supported by a knowledgeable supervisor and team leaders who work collaboratively to provide quality care and learning programmes. Well-considered leadership provides valued support for teachers and contributes to the centre's calm and settled environment for children.</p><p>Kindercare provides sound frameworks to guide centre operations. The area manager provides leaders with useful support and guidance to meet Kindercare's requirements and philosophy. Teachers with leadership aspirations are well supported by Kindercare to develop their leadership skills. Teacher appraisal systems meet the requirements of the Education Council of New Zealand. Self-review processes are guided by a detailed framework provided by Kindercare. These frameworks support leaders and teachers to effectively review key aspects of the centres operations.</p><h3>Key Next Step</h3><p>ERO and centre leaders agree that the next key step for leaders is to build consistency of effective teaching practice. Consideration should be given, to developing with teachers, shared and agreed expectations for high quality teaching and learning at Kindercare Learning Centres - Thomas Road.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kindercare Learning Centres - Thomas Road completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kindercare Learning Centres - Thomas Road will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p>Waikato/Bay of Plenty</p><p>12 June 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
