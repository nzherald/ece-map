</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Miramar North Kindergarten is in Wellington. The service is licensed for 40 children aged over two years. Of the 80 children enrolled, seven are Māori and five are Pacific. It is one of 85 kindergartens and three home-based education and care networks governed and managed by He Whānau Manaaki o Tararua Free Kindergarten Association Incorporated (the association). This is a new kindergarten association created from joining the Rimutaka and Wellington Kindergarten Associations in 2014.</p><p>The board and managers provide governance for the organisation. Senior teachers have delegated kindergartens. Their role is to provide regular support and a range of professional learning and development opportunities for teachers.</p><p>In 2012, the association developed a framework to guide the implementation of its curriculum, Te Manawa. This document outlines criteria for curriculum delivery including expectations for assessment and planning for children’s learning.</p><p>The February 2012 ERO report for Miramar North Kindergarten identified a number of areas needing further development including, self review, assessment of children's learning, practices to support children's sense of belonging and strategies to assist their transitions to school. These have been a priority for staff and considerable progress has been made. Internal evaluation and assessment of children's learning remain aspects of the programme requiring further development.</p><p>Areas where the association could strengthen its support for teachers were also identified, and positive progress has occurred. The alignment of individual kindergartens’ annual plans with the association’s strategic priorities has now been appropriately addressed.</p><p>Since the previous ERO report, there have been some changes to the teaching team. A new teacher joined the staff in 2016.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 10 reviews in the He Whānau Manaaki o Tararua kindergartens.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The kindergarten philosophy is highly evident in practice. Children are learning to become problem solvers, negotiators and explorers. They confidently lead their own learning.</p><p>Teachers have high expectations of children and effectively support their developing social skills. This contributes significantly to the sense of rangimarie in the kindergarten. A calm, purposeful atmosphere is evident.</p><p>Children and whānau are warmly welcomed into the kindergarten in a relaxed, unhurried manner. They are encouraged to settle at their own pace. A well-considered range of strategies supports older children and their families as they prepare for their move to school.</p><p>Teachers plan a curriculum which successfully responds to children's interests, strengths and diverse cultural backgrounds. Assessment of children's learning shows significant progress since the previous ERO review. The senior teacher and head teacher have identified a programme of clear next steps to continue this ongoing development. ERO agrees with this approach.</p><p>Aspects of te reo me ngā tikanga Māori are woven throughout the curriculum. Teachers' use of <em>Tātaiako: Cultural Competencies for Teachers of Māori Learners</em> is increasingly strengthening their practice in supporting educational success for Māori children.</p><p>Children with additional needs play and learn alongside their friends. Teachers work in partnership with families and external agencies to meet individual learning goals. Their responsiveness to children's wellbeing is highly evident.</p><p>There has been an increasing focus on ways adults can support Pacific children. With guidance from the association, and Pacific families, teachers are beginning to further their knowledge and understanding.</p><p>Strong, well-established relationships with families are evident. Teachers frequently refer to the 'kindergarten community' and this is highly evident as teachers, families and children learn together.</p><p>Improving internal evaluation has been a considerable focus in the kindergarten. Progress is evident and has led to positive change. The senior teacher, head teacher and teachers recognise they now need to embed this evaluative approach into their practice. ERO agrees.</p><p>Staff are improvement focused. The head teacher fosters a culture of reflection and constructive critique. She encourages teachers to use their strengths to contribute to the kindergarten community.</p><p>The senior teacher provides termly written feedback that outlines agreed development priorities and progress in relation to the quality of teaching and learning. She completes an annual internal evaluation that supports strengthening of these termly reports. There is a deliberate focus on outcomes for children and teacher/leader performance. This has been successful in promoting improved practices in the kindergarten.</p><p>The previous ERO report identified that the association needed to improve the appraisal processes. Managers undertook an internal review of the appraisal system. The revised model is being implemented across the kindergartens. The process includes focused goals that build teacher and leader capability and clearer links with the Practising Teacher Criteria. Staff at Miramar North Kindergarten are implementing the revised appraisal model.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The senior teacher, head teacher, staff and ERO agree on the following key next steps for Miramar North Kindergarten to continue:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>to embed internal evaluation into practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to strengthen assessment and evaluation of children's learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The association should continue to support the development of formal critique of teaching practice and strengthening of responsiveness to Māori children.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Miramar North Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Miramar North Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>27 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
