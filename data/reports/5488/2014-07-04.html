</table><p>The Terrace Kindergarten requires further development to ensure a strong focus on children&rsquo;s learning.</p><p>The kindergarten needs ongoing support from the Central Otago Kindergarten Association (COKA) in order to be considered well placed.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Terrace Kindergarten is located in Alexandra, close to Dunstan High School. The kindergarten is licensed for 40 children from two-to-five years of age. Some children attend the kindergarten and a number of other early childhood services. Since the November 2010 ERO report, there have been significant staffing changes. This continues to have an effect on the quality of planning and programmes provided for children.</p><p>Children enjoy playing and learning in a large outdoor environment with established trees.</p><p>The supportive parent committee provides substantial funding to upgrade the buildings and outdoor areas.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of seven kindergarten reviews in the Central Otago Kindergarten Association (COKA).</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their parents are welcomed on arrival. Many parents feel comfortable to stay and play alongside their children. Teachers are responsive to children and their family needs. Teachers and children interact positively with each other. At times of possible conflict some teachers help children to think about how to problem solve and how to be good friends. ERO observed many children playing in small groups for sustained periods of time.</p><p>Children take part in a wide variety of interesting activities and experiences. Teachers welcome parents and children to share their expertise and cultures. For example, a mum teaching Mandarin, a dad shearing sheep and parents bringing their ponies for children to ride. Children prepare their own food and enjoy each other&rsquo;s company at the kindergarten caf&eacute;. Children learn to take responsibility for aspects of their own health and wellbeing.</p><p>The kindergarten is well resourced with a variety of equipment to stimulate and provide children with challenge. Aspects of the programme are based on children&rsquo;s interests. Some teachers asked useful questions to help children to think more deeply. Teachers have sought and responded to advice about how to support children&rsquo;s speech and language development. Early literacy and numeracy is included throughout the programmes.</p><p>Children regularly hear and practice te reo M&#257;ori. Many are able to share their mihi and karakia, and count in te reo M&#257;ori. Teachers seek parents&rsquo; of M&#257;ori children&rsquo;s wishes for their child&rsquo;s learning and development. A M&#257;ori resource teacher provides weekly support for children and teachers in deepening their understanding of te ao M&#257;ori.</p><p>Currently, under three-year old children attend the afternoon sessions. Teachers have considered carefully how to provide for these children. They make adaptations to equipment so that younger children can use it.</p><p><em>Governance</em></p><p>Over the past three years the Central Otago Kindergarten Association has gone through an unsettled period. There has been a break down in governance, management and systems which has adversely affected the effectiveness and level of leadership provided to each kindergarten. This has led to the board contracting Canterbury Westland Kindergarten Association (trading as Kidsfirst Kindergartens) in 2012 to undertake an independent review of the management structure. Then in September 2013, Canterbury Westland Kindergarten Association was contacted again to provide management support and guidance in an effort to establish robust systems, competent leadership and management. The process for redevelopment is still underway. New systems are being established and at the time of this review, ERO found it was too early to tell how well they would be implemented. Overall, there has been a substantial turnover of teachers within the association. ERO also found that the appraisal process was not robust and needs further development.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO has identified, and the leaders agree, that a number of areas require further development and review at Terrace Kindergarten to be effective in providing high-quality education and care for children. The head teacher and teachers must develop and implement more robust systems to support purposeful planning, assessment, evaluation and self review. Once embedded these systems should be reviewed to ensure they are effective.</p><p>The head teacher and teachers need to:</p><ul>
<li>ensure a strong learning focus when planning for individuals and groups</li>
<li>implement more consistently a system that ensures all children&rsquo;s learning is regularly discussed and planned for</li>
<li>show children&rsquo;s progress and continuity of learning in records</li>
<li>show how they have helped children to learn</li>
<li>evaluate how effective their programmes and teaching strategies are.</li>
</ul><p>Self review would be more effective if teachers used an evaluative question to focus their inquiry and developed indicators to identify what best practice looks like.</p><p>Under-three-year old children have been attending afternoon sessions for one year. It is now timely to review how well teaching practices and programmes support these younger children.</p><p>The leadership needs to be strengthened and strategic so that sustainable improvements can be made to what happens for children.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of The Terrace Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the service, in consultation with the Ministry of Education, develops a plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of The Terrace Kindergarten will be within two years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>4 July 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are M&#257;ori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ng&#257; Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/Frameworks-and-Evaluation-Indicators-for-ERO-Reviews/He-Pou-Tataki-How-ERO-reviews-early-childhoood-sevices"> ERO&rsquo;s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO&rsquo;s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development &ndash; The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO&rsquo;s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service&rsquo;s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
