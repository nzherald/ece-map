</table><p>Kidsfirst Kindergartens Mairehau is very well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kidsfirst Kindergartens Mairehau is one of 71 early learning services governed and managed by Canterbury Westland Free Kindergarten Association Incorporated, trading as Kidsfirst Kindergartens. The kindergarten caters for the education and care of young children from the diverse and culturally rich community that it serves.</p><p>The association's education service manager (ESM) provides consistent professional advice and guidance to support the effective operation of the service. All teachers, including the additional support teacher are fully qualified and certified in early childhood education.</p><p>Teachers continue to provide ongoing support for children and families still being affected by the aftermath of the Canterbury Earthquakes.</p><p>The ESM and teachers have responded positively to the recommendations outlined in the 2012 ERO report. Children now have increased opportunities to hear and use te reo Māori. The kindergarten's vision and values clearly reflect the aspirations of their families and the kindergarten's priorities. The programme is closely aligned with the <em>Te Whāriki,</em> early childhood curriculum. Teachers now use an improved process to guide internal evaluation.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of nine Kidsfirst Kindergartens in the Canterbury Westland Free Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The kindergarten's vision and values are well embedded and highly evident in kindergarten practices. Children learn and play in a secure and calm environment. They are encouraged to be respectful of each other and of the environment.</p><p>Children have a wide range of resources that effectively encourage their exploration. The discoveries they make successfully extend their knowledge of the world around them. The interesting and varied outdoor equipment provides many naturally-occurring physical challenges.</p><p>The care of children and their families strongly reflects tikanga Māori, in particular manaakitanga (caring, nurturing) and whanaungatanga (positive, relationships). Teachers build trusting relationships with parents and whānau. Parents are well informed of their children’s wellbeing, learning and participation in the programmes. Teachers plan meaningful experiences that support parents' desired outcomes for their children's learning.</p><p>Teachers are highly reflective. They identify teaching strategies that effectively add depth to their practice and to learning experiences for children. Literacy, numeracy, science and creative experiences are well integrated into the programme. Teachers proactively support the development of children's oral language by providing stimulating resources. They work closely with specialists and agencies to meet the additional needs of individual children.</p><p>Teachers celebrate the languages, cultures and identities of children and their families. They regularly promote bicultural perspectives in their teaching practices and in the kindergarten documents. They maintain good links with local schools to foster positive transitions for children and families.</p><p>Teachers have a systematic approach to internal evaluation that is clearly focused on outcomes for children. They are collaborative and use their strengths to achieve the kindergarten's goals. The head teacher and ESM provide experienced leadership. This includes professional advice and guidance to manage changes and sustain a positive learning environment for children and their families.</p><p>The Canterbury Westland Free Kindergarten Association is well supported by an experienced, professional board. The association has a well-understood vision and targeted strategic and annual plans. There are close links between the kindergarten plans, internal evaluation, appraisal and professional development. Teachers are well supported by association managers and leaders to achieve the priorities of the association and their own kindergarten objectives and vision, to provide high quality learning outcomes for all children.</p><p>The association has a very strong commitment to providing high quality professional development to build on leadership capacity and teacher capability. It has high expectations for teaching and learning and equitable outcomes for all children. This includes the appointment of a kaitautoko to further promote a strong focus on Tiriti aspirations at all levels of the organisation.</p><p>The Canterbury Westland Free Kindergarten Association is innovative in its approaches and regularly seeks opportunities to be involved in the wider educational and local communities to promote high quality learning outcomes for all children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The ESM and ERO agree, that the key next step is to continue to build all teachers' capacity to lead complex internal evaluations.</p><p>The chief executive has identified and ERO’s evaluation has confirmed, that the key next step for the association is to continue its improvement long-term plan, ensuring that enhancements to its buildings reflect the changing needs of its communities.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Mairehau completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kidsfirst Kindergartens Mairehau will be in four years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer, Southern - Te Waipounamu</p><p>21 March 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
