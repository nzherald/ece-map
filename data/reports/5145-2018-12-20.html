</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Hillcrest Kindergarten, located in the eastern suburbs of Hamilton, is licensed for 43 children. The kindergarten offers both full and part-day education and care for children from two years to school age. Children come from a diverse range of ethnic backgrounds and for many English is an additional language. At the time of this ERO review 54 children were enrolled, including six who identify as Māori.</p><p>The kindergarten is one of 29 kindergartens that operate under the Waikato Kindergarten Association (WKA), which is a charitable trust. The strategic direction of the association is guided by the overarching statement, ‘Our children are strong in heart, head and hand’. The WKA has a commitment to providing quality, inclusive services that effectively meet the diverse educational needs of all children attending. Advice, guidance and support is provided to the organisation by a kaumātua from Tainui.</p><p>All kindergartens in the WKA are involved in a ‘Cool 4 School’ transition programme and sustainable education, environment and health programmes such as Enviroschools and Sport Waikato 'Under 5 Energise'. The kindergartens’ education, operational and administrative responsibilities are supported by experienced association personnel.</p><p>The Hillcrest philosophy states that the kindergarten fosters children’s curiosity, independence and resilience within an inclusive, respectful and natural environment and the curriculum goals of <em>Te Whāriki</em> are embedded in the programme which is anchored by a commitment to the Treaty of Waitangi.</p><p>Since the previous ERO review in 2015 the kindergarten has been re-licensed to reflect the increase in operational hours and numbers. There have been some changes to leadership and the teaching team. The kindergarten has responded well to the key areas for development in the previous ERO report. Substantial redevelopment of the outdoor environment has increased children's access to resources. Teachers have strengthened their bicultural knowledge and understanding.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of eight reviews in the Waikato Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children experience trusting and respectful relationships with teachers. Teachers are making effective use of learning conversations to encourage children to problem solve and to extend their thinking. Children are well supported to build their knowledge about New Zealand’s unique cultural heritage through the use of te reo and tikanga Māori. The kindergarten's inclusive culture enables children for whom English is an additional language to feel welcome and secure. Children with special learning and development needs are well supported through close cooperation with appropriate external agencies.</p><p>A wide range of meaningful learning opportunities enrich the kindergarten's curriculum. The well-resourced learning environment promotes curiosity, challenge and independence through open-ended resources. The large, natural redesigned outdoor area provides children with many opportunities to develop their confidence and resilience through risk taking and physical challenge. Teaching includes a focus on sustainable environmental practices, where children learn care and respect for the world around them.</p><p>The WKA has recently developed a new individualised planning process to support teachers to respond to the learning and development needs of children. Leaders recognise the importance of fully embedding this process. Assessment portfolios records each child's interests and engagement in the life of the kindergarten. They are regularly accessed by children and families enabling children to share and revisit their learning. Online assessment also allows families to contribute to and share children's learning experiences.</p><p>Transitions into and from the centre are responsive to the needs and wishes of families. Teachers are building useful relationships with local primary schools. A meaningful transition programme supports children as they move on to school.</p><p>Leadership of the kindergarten is effective. Leaders have developed a supportive and respectful culture which is underpinned by shared values, beliefs and mutual trust. A collaborative approach maximises the strengths of the teaching team and is focused on growing teacher capability.</p><p>Education services managers (ESMs) work closely with the head teacher and provide well-informed professional leadership to support kindergarten operation. The WKA has recently reviewed its teacher appraisal process. Ensuring this new process is fully implemented is a priority for ESMs.</p><p>The WKA provides comprehensive systems, policies and procedures to guide kindergarten practice. Teachers have access to ongoing and targeted professional development to promote improved practice and contribute to positive outcomes for children. Effective governance by the WKA is contributing to inclusive and equitable services for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The key next step for leaders and teachers are to further develop their understanding of the expectations of the revised <em>Te Whāriki</em> particularly in relation to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>assessment planning and evaluation processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the development of a local curriculum that reflects parent aspirations and the unique nature of Hillcrest Kindergarten.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Hillcrest Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Hillcrest Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>20 December 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
