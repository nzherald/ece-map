</table><p>ABC Rolleston BestStart Educare is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>ABC Rolleston operates under the BestStart Educare Ltd management structure. Beststart (previously known as Kidicorp Ltd) is a large national organisation that owns a number of early childhood education centres across New Zealand.</p><p>This centre is licensed for 50 children. It has two distinct areas to cater for children under two years old and for children aged between two and five years old. Children and staff in both areas have regular opportunities to interact with one another. This provides a sense of whānagatanga - family and community.</p><p>Since the previous ERO review in October 2012 there have been some changes to the leadership and management of the centre, including the appointment of a new centre manager in 2014. Most teachers are qualified and registered.</p><p>Centre leaders have made good progress with the areas recommended for development in the previous 2012 ERO report. This includes development of assessment, preschool programme, practices and resourcing; and the promotion of bicultural understandings. The inside nursery area, and the whole centre outside playground areas have had a significant upgrade, including new play equipment.</p><p>The centre manager and some teachers are part of a local community cluster of primary schools, and early childhood centres. This is beginning to provide professional networks and some professional development to support the learning and transition of children in the community from early childhood to school.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Centre leaders and teachers provide an inclusive learning environment for children. They foster positive and reciprocal relationships with children, parents and whanau. They warmly welcome families, celebrate diversity and respect different cultures, beliefs and values.</p><p>Centre leaders and teachers use a range of successful methods to communicate and consult with families. Teachers and parents share information to support children’s learning and wellbeing. Parent and whanau involvement in the programme and contribution to the programme is valued.</p><p>The child-centred curriculum has a strong focus on children learning through play. Teachers are interested in, and responsive to, the individual needs and passions of each child. Literacy, numeracy and oral language development are a strong feature of the programme. Teachers provide a wide range of authentic, fun, learning experiences that are meaningful to children.</p><p>Children are encouraged to be respectful, to take responsibility for themselves, and to care for others and the environment. Children have long periods of uninterrupted time to make their own discoveries, develop friendships and extend on ideas. Excursions into the community enhance the learning programme.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are well supported to develop secure relationships with key teachers. Flexible centre practices reflect parents’ expectations and the children’s home routines. Teachers are respectful, nurturing and caring. They provide sensitive, calm, child-paced interactions.</p><p>Parents are well informed of their child’s interests and participation at the centre through attractive wall displays and informative learning stories. Transitions into the centre and between rooms are responsive to the individual needs of the child and family.</p><p>The centre is well led and managed. Leaders and teachers are very reflective and involved in ongoing professional development to build on professional practices. The staff work well together. Teachers' strengths are recognised and valued. Teachers lead the development of te reo and tikanga Māori; and use their home languages with children and families where English as a second language.</p><p>The centre manager, professional service manager and the business manager work in partnership to successfully implement BestStart effective management systems including quality assurance and strategic planning processes. These include:</p><ul>
<li>a well understood and effective review process</li>
<li>useful support for centre managers and regular guidance and visits of education and visits from the BestStart managers</li>
<li>provision of useful professional development</li>
<li>effective systems and processes for promoting safe and healthy learning environments.</li>
</ul><p>Centre leaders are focused on ongoing improvement and positive learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders are highly reflective. They have self-identified key areas for improvement and are developing a number of initiatives. ERO agree the next step is to refine, strengthen and embed:</p><ul>
<li>assessment, planning and self-review processes</li>
<li>bicultural perspectives across all aspects of centre operation and curriculum</li>
<li>professional relationships with schools to support transition to school processes.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of ABC Rolleston will be in three years.</p><p>Chris Rowe</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Acting)</p><p>25 January 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
