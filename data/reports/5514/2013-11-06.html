</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Clarendon Kindergarten is located in South Invercargill and provides extended morning sessions for up to 30 children. The long serving head teacher has positive relationships with families. Some of these span several generations. The kindergarten is a focal point for many of the families in the community. Teachers are very inclusive of the diverse backgrounds of the children who attend.</p><p>Children have a choice of up to eight different schools when they leave kindergarten.</p><p>The kindergarten philosophy is very evident in practice. The key values are:</p><ul>
<li>whanaungatanga (creating a sense of family)</li>
<li>manaakitanga (hospitality)</li>
<li>kaitiakitanga (respect for the environment)</li>
<li>tuakana/teina (buddy system)</li>
<li>&#363;ikaip&#333;tanga (knowing this is your place).</li>
</ul><p>Teachers have made good progress in implementing the recommendations from the August 2010 ERO report, through improving the environment, planning and assessment.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 23 kindergarten reviews in the Southland Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>A special feature of this kindergarten is the way teachers build children&rsquo;s positive self esteem. Children and their wh&#257;nau benefit from loving and trusting relationships with their teachers. Wh&#257;nau are encouraged to stay, relax and enjoy their children in the kindergarten. Teachers provide a calm, comfortable environment that supports children&rsquo;s emotional wellbeing.</p><p>ERO observed children having fun, playing cooperatively and problem solving together.</p><p>Conversations teachers have with children extend their thinking, language and learning. Children benefit from the purposeful routines, resources and experiences. For example, as a way to build their independence children are given responsibility for making their own morning tea and lunches.</p><p>The head teacher and teachers know the children and their life contexts very well. They provide a responsive programme to extend individual children&rsquo;s knowledge, skills and interests. All children are supported to enable them to participate in the programme. This is evident in the way the head teacher effectively liaises with external agencies. She and the teachers use the suggested strategies diligently to further support children&rsquo;s learning and development. Teachers sensitively support children and their families when children are preparing to start school.</p><p>Teachers provide a wide range of experiences for children to have fun and learn. These include:</p><ul>
<li>using the expertise of people in the community and visitors to the kindergarten</li>
<li>outings to events and the local community</li>
<li>te reo M&#257;ori, waiata and tikanga M&#257;ori</li>
<li>learning how to take responsibility and care for pets</li>
<li>introducing children to the love of books and language within the kindergarten and at home.</li>
</ul><p>Children learn about themselves and the wider world. Their interests are used as a springboard for group programmes that grow and develop in complexity over time. Teachers value children&rsquo;s work and learning. Their art work is attractively displayed.</p><p>The large outdoor area has native plantings and spaces for children to explore and develop their physical skills. There are spaces for children to be alone or play together. The indoor resources invite children to become fully involved in a wide variety of activities.</p><p>The head teacher has developed partnerships with families and has collaborative ways of working with her team.</p><p>The Kindergarten South governors consulted widely when developing the vision and goals that guide the long term direction of the association. They have high expectations that the association and each kindergarten will:</p><ul>
<li>involve the community</li>
<li>provide natural learning environments</li>
<li>do what is best for children</li>
<li>be a good employer.</li>
</ul><p>The association is committed to transforming each kindergarten&rsquo;s outdoor play area. Children now play and learn in beautiful and natural environments.</p><p>Governors and staff have a clear understanding of the roles of governance and management in the association. They have developed a useful policy framework and guidelines that support the day-to-day and long-term operation of the kindergartens.</p><p>The advisory-support teachers provide useful feedback and guidance to staff and endorse the high expectations set by the board of governors. Clarendon Kindergarten benefits from strong ongoing support from the general manager and other association staff.</p><h3>Next Steps</h3><p>The head teacher and teachers have identified that their next step is to build on and embed their planning and assessment practices to more clearly show children&rsquo;s learning and progress over time.</p><p>The teaching team intends to further strengthen self-review practices to sustain their ongoing performance.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Clarendon Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Clarendon Kindergarten will be in four years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>6 November 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO&rsquo;s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service&rsquo;s strengths and next steps for development. ERO&rsquo;s bicultural evaluation framework Ng&#257; Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> &ndash; self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> &ndash; partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are M&#257;ori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ng&#257; Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/Frameworks-and-Evaluation-Indicators-for-ERO-Reviews/He-Pou-Tataki-How-ERO-reviews-early-childhoood-sevices"> ERO&rsquo;s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO&rsquo;s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed &ndash; The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development &ndash; The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO&rsquo;s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service&rsquo;s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
