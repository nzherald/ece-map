</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Khandallah Little School is a privately owned centre located in Khandallah, Wellington. It is one of three services under the Little School umbrella management and provides education and care for up to 30 children aged over two.</p><p>The service’s management team comprises the owner-manager and two mentor teachers. The owner-manager has a clear vision for the service and is responsible for setting overall strategic and policy direction. Mentor teachers monitor the quality of teaching and learning and support teachers’ ongoing professional learning and growth. Three teachers are provisionally registered.</p><p>The January 2012 ERO report identified a number of areas for development and review. Management sought professional development with an external facilitator to develop understanding of review for improvement.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>During times of a child-initiated, play-based curriculum children are engaged and motivated by spontaneous and planned experiences. Their mathematical learning is enhanced through meaningful and interesting opportunities to use mathematics in everyday life. This learning programme, aligned to <em>Te Whāriki</em>, is relevant and responsive to children’s interests and adult-initiated ideas. Integrating some of these approaches into the more structured group times should further enhance children's learning.</p><p>Teachers demonstrate respectful and affirming relationships with children. They are nurturing and play alongside children. Teachers promote and model positive values and behaviours. Children’s interactions with each other are friendly and amicable. Staff are supportive and respond promptly to children’s requests and their physical and emotional needs. Teachers should consider ways to further develop conversations that include good use of questioning and modelling of language.</p><p>Children’s participation and involvement in the programme is increasingly celebrated and shared between teachers and parents. The introduction of e-Portfolios, since the previous ERO review, contributes to the strengthening of assessment and planning processes. Service mentors have identified that continued support and guidance is required to build teachers' capability in assessment.</p><p>Teachers focus on developing close partnerships between homes and the centre. Parents are frequently in the centre and welcome to join in at any time. They contribute through regular discussion and sharing ideas with teachers about how they may support children at home and at the centre. There is an unobtrusive approach to supporting families with particular needs.</p><p>ERO observed some use of te reo Māori and tikanga practices that children respond to. Teachers have expressed that the bicultural programme and building on to and giving significance to Māori learners’ culture, language, and identity are areas to strengthen. ERO agrees with this direction. A next step for teachers is to make use of <em>Ka</em> <em>Hikitia - Accelerating Success 2013-2017</em> and <em>Tātaiako: Cultural Competencies for Teachers of Māori learners</em> to strengthen responsiveness to Māori.</p><p>Teachers are reflective and focus on maintaining a safe emotional and physical learning environment. A newly introduced online appraisal process encourages teacher reflection and informs professional learning opportunities for staff. Self review continues to be an area to further strengthen. The owner, mentors and teachers need to distinguish between reviewing for accountability and evaluating for improvement. Developing robust ways of knowing the impact of teaching practices on children’s learning and development should lead to improved outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The owner, mentors and teachers should continue to improve and develop their understanding of and practices in:</p><ul>
<li>self review, to more clearly show the impact of teachers’ practices on learning outcomes for children</li>
<li>appraisal processes, that promote professional accountability and consistent, formal critique of teaching practice and feedback to improve teaching and learning.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Khandallah Little School completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Khandallah Little School will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region</p><p>30 April 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here:</a></p><ul>
<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"> ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
