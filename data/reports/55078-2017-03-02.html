</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Waiapu Kids - Te Hapara Whanau Aroha, was previously known as Te Hapara Whanau Aroha Centre. The service operates under the umbrella of the Waiapu Anglican Social Services Trust Board. Management and day-to-day operation of the centre are delegated to the centre manager, who reports to a regional director. The centre manager and the tumuaki team leader share responsibility for curriculum implementation and guiding teaching practice. There have been some staff changes in the last year.</p><p>All day education and care is offered for 50 children, including 20 aged up to two years. The majority of children attending are Māori. The service emphasises whole-whānau health and holistic wellbeing for their tamariki. Two vans are provided daily to transport children and whānau to and from the centre. A social worker and counsellor are available to families in an adjoining building. The centre is regularly visited by a Plunket nurse, public health nurse, mobile dental service and ear specialist.</p><p>The centre is divided into two age groups. Infants and toddlers have indoor and outdoor playspaces separate to those of older children. Regular interaction between age groups is promoted by teachers.</p><p>Waiapu Kids - Te Hapara Whanau Aroha has been responsive to many of the next steps identified in the October 2014 ERO report. Leaders and teachers have engaged in a range of professional learning, including Ministry of Education funded support for self review and leadership, through the Strengthening Early Learning Opportunities (SELO) programme. They have developed a shared philosophy, a strategic plan and various systems and frameworks. It is evident that some progress has been made in assessment, planning, evaluation, appraisal and self review, however further work is still required. Systems and processes related to health and safety are in urgent need of development. </p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children confidently engage in the programme. A strong bicultural emphasis underpins the curriculum. Children benefit from seeing, hearing and experiencing elements of te reo me ngā tikanga Māori. They have regular opportunities to participate in waiata and kapa haka, including through performance at community festivals.</p><p>Teachers of older children follow their interests and support them in their play. A wide range of experiences, excursions and planned activities extend the programme. Mathematics is strongly promoted, through a variety of strategies. However, the quality of teaching practice is variable. Some teachers are responsive in their provision of resources and activities. Children would benefit from an increased focus on the provision of challenge and complexity, in all areas of the curriculum.</p><p>Care routines are flexible to the needs and rhythms of children up to two. Interactions are warm and teachers know children well. Some teachers show high levels of respect and responsiveness to infants' and toddlers' preferences, interests and growing independence.</p><p>The value inherent in Pacific children's cultural heritage is acknowledged and suitably celebrated. The weaving of all children's cultures, languages and identities through the curriculum and assessment documentation is evident. This should be further strengthened through the purposeful gathering of cultural aspirations whānau have for their children, and targeted planning in response.</p><p>Children with additional needs are identified and well supported. External agencies are accessed where appropriate to support individual children. The implementation and monitoring of these individual education plans is evident in children's assessment documentation and a next step should include highlighting the link to the plan in a more purposeful way.</p><p>Planning and assessment for individual children has been recently redeveloped. This includes liaison with whānau about learning aspirations for their children, clear links to the early childhood curriculum, <em>Te Whāriki</em> and a range of intended teaching strategies. It is now timely to focus on more in-depth assessment of children's learning and analysis of information to inform the quality of the curriculum provided.</p><p>Leaders and teachers have worked to establish a new philosophy document to guide centre operation, in consultation with whānau. Intent and expectations of the philosophy statements have been clarified with the team. The centre would benefit from a stronger focus on the philosophy in terms of high quality practice expectations and this can then be monitored by leaders through appraisal.</p><p>Appraisal occurs regularly and promotes teachers' inquiry into their practice. This process requires strengthening through the development and implementation of robust guiding procedures. This should include the use of:</p><ul>
<li>goals that challenge the teacher</li>
<li>targeted observations of teachers' practice, linked to their goals</li>
<li>critical feedback and feed forward</li>
<li>evidence to demonstrate that teachers meet all 12 practising teacher criteria over each appraisal year.</li>
</ul><p>In addition, the centre should establish a clear outline of the role and expectations of registering teachers.</p><p>Regular reviews are now occurring with a focus on improvement and outcomes for children. However, the current process should be reworked to enable teachers to systematically inquire into and evaluate the effectiveness of teacher practice. Teachers require support to develop their knowledge of the purpose and use of internal evaluation.</p><p>The Waiapu Anglican Social Services Trust Board must increase their support and monitoring of management's understanding of all policies and procedures. The implementation of these systems should then be more closely supervised by management.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>To improve outcomes for children, leaders and teachers should further develop:</p><ul>
<li>the service curriculum</li>
<li>assessment, planning and evaluation processes</li>
<li>expectations for effective teaching</li>
<li>internal evaluation capacity and capability.</li>
</ul><p>Management, should give priority to the development of robust procedures for: assessment, planning, review and evaluation; appraisal; and the registration process for provisionally certificated teachers.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Waiapu Kids - Te Hapara Whanau Aroha completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children’s health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements </p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO found significant areas of non-compliance in the service related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>ensuring that children are adequately supervised at all times</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improving and consistently enacting excursion policies and procedures.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008,</em> Schedule 2 adult -to child ratios, HS17.</p><p>To improve practice the centre should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>more clearly inform parents regarding ratios and supervision on transport vans</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>revisit and improve procedures relating to medication</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>create a procedure document to guide earthquake drills.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Since the onsite phase of the review some of the identified areas relating to compliance have been addressed.</p><h3>Recommendation to Ministry of Education</h3><p>ERO recommends that the Ministry reassess the licence of Waiapu Kids - Te Hapara Whanau Aroha. ERO will not undertake a further education review of this service until the Ministry of Education is satisfied that the service meets licensing requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Waiapu Kids - Te Hapara Whanau Aroha will be in consultation with the Ministry of Education.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central 2 March 2017 </p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
