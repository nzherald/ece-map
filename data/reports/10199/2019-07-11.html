</table><p>Starship Play Service Ward 26A &amp; 26B is very well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The Ward 26A and 26B licence is one of seven at Starship Hospital. The services operate as part of the Auckland District Health Board (ADHB), the Starship Children's Health Directorate, and Starship Allied Health. A highly qualified clinical team leader has responsibility for the daily operation of the service and leads a team of 31 hospital play specialists (HPS), assisted by an early childhood education curriculum leader.</p><p>Ward 26A is the Neuroservices ward, and 26B provides Medical Specialist services for children from across New Zealand and the Pacific. This recently combined licence is for 27 children up to six years of age. It is operated by five qualified early childhood teachers, who hold or are working towards Hospital Play Specialist (HPS) qualifications.</p><p>The HPS implement <em>Te Whārik</em>i, the early childhood curriculum, and strategies for dealing with hospitalisation through play and support in playrooms and at children's bedsides. The philosophy for this service references the ADHB Child Health aims of Welcome - Haere Mai, Respect - Manaaki, Together - Tūhono, and Aim High - Angamua.</p><p>The vision, strategic direction and values are clearly articulated. The Children’s Health Directorate promotes the value of play, and provides support and resources to the hospital play services. The service is a contributing, vital component of multidisciplinary teams. The Starship Foundation provides significant additional resourcing.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of seven Starship Play Service reviews. The 2016 cluster review identified a variety of good practices. It noted areas for improvement that have been addressed.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their whānau are warmly welcomed. They have opportunities to engage in meaningful, self-chosen play, guided by experienced, highly skilled and dedicated HPS practitioners. Respectful, inclusive and caring approaches quickly build close relationships between HPS and children and whānau. The HPS work with children is sensitive and designed to engage whānau in play as a way to help children to build trust and reduce anxiety. Children respond positively to the attention and care they receive from HPS who work in highly collaborative ways.</p><p>The service is committed to fostering children's resilience and wellbeing, and to supporting the hospital community through evidence-based, culturally responsive, holistic play-based learning. All HPS advocate for and empower whānau and children as experts about their own wellbeing and work with medical staff to improve experiences for children.</p><p>Children's 'taonga books' about their individual journeys through their time in hospital are usually a shared endeavour by children, whānau and HPS and are much valued. Many of the children in 26B stay for extended periods, and revisit their taonga books often to renew a sense of belonging. Whānau and children in Wards 26A and 26B treasure these books.</p><p>Programmes in the playroom are child-led and interest-based when possible. Planning is highly responsive and often related to children's immediate needs. HPS' evaluation of their work is reflective and often shared to gain insights into effective practices, at regular team meetings and in medical notes. The recently developed clinical coaching team provides expertise, mentoring and support for learning modules towards HPS qualifications.</p><p>The playroom is purposefully designed, inviting and thoughtfully presented. High quality resources and innovative ideas support children's creativity and learning. HPS frequently support medical staff with preparation for procedures. Healthcare play equipment assists children to engage in medical preparation and therapeutic play. Great sensitivity and a multidisciplinary approach supports children's transitions into, through and out of the hospital.</p><p>An internationally designed programme, Snoezelen, supports wellbeing, and is available in this playroom twice a week. Children eagerly access this programme and benefit from the carefully designed ambience and tactile play that promotes relaxation and engagement. The addition of a music therapist in the ward for half a day each week provides valuable and much enjoyed music therapy that works effectively to engage children.</p><p>Service leaders are committed to embedding te ao Māori in programmes. Te reo and tikanga Māori are reflected in the programmes and environments. HPS have built their capability and confidence in bicultural practice through targeted professional development and shared evaluation. Feedback from whānau is highly positive. HPS are making a concerted effort to develop their understanding of, and support for, children and families from the Pacific and further afield.</p><p>Relationships underpin all aspects of HPS and management practices. A high trust model and strong professional relationships with other staff are evident. HPS are well supported through regular opportunities for professional learning within and outside the hospital, and at overseas conferences. Appraisal processes are thorough. Strategic and annual planning have been developed to align with Starship Child Health Directorate strategic goals and more specific HPS goals. A consistently high level of good practice is evident across the service.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Next steps for HPS and management team include:</p><ul>
<li>continuing to implement and support the ongoing development of programmes that enhance provision for children and families</li>
<li>documenting procedures for the induction and mentoring of provisionally registered teachers, and specifically linking appraisals to Teaching Council standards.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Starship Play Service Ward 26A &amp; 26B completed an <em>ERO Hospital-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Northern</p><p><span>Northern Region</span></p><p>11 July 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service responds to children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to two years of age.</p><p><i>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to the methodology for ERO reviews in Hospital-based Education and Care Services.</i></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed</li>
<li>Well placed</li>
<li>Requires further development</li>
<li>Not well placed</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that contribute to children’s learning and wellbeing and are useful to the service.</p>
