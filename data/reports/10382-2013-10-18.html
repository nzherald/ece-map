</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kids Unlimited (Learning Centre) Ltd, located in Mt Albert, Auckland, caters for a maximum of 34 children from birth to five years of age. It is an all day education and care service where older children play in mixed-age groups and children under two years of age have a separate room. Specialised age-related teaching sessions occur for all children each afternoon.</p><p>The centre is multicultural and children come from the local area to take advantage of the home-like environment. Staff numbers have recently been enhanced due to the centre’s increased roll. The majority of staff are either fully qualified or in training.</p><p>The centre has four directors, with the head teacher and service provider owning and managing the service. The owners have responded positively to the priorities identified for review and development in the 2010 ERO report. Management systems, administration procedures and curriculum support underpin centre operations.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children receive good quality care and education. Children are warmly welcomed to the centre and teachers develop friendly relationships with parents and whānau. Teachers use some te reo Māori during the day. Some aspects of cultural identity are displayed in the centre. The owners seek parent help and advice on cultural practices. Multicultural aspects are evident within the learning environment. However, there needs to be further work on implementation.</p><p>The centre timetable allows for both regular routines and time for children to explore and play within the attractive and well organised environment. The outdoor area includes weather protection for all year round play. Although the outdoor space is limited, the teachers makes good use of this learning environment for children.</p><p>Teachers offer appropriate age-related group teaching and learning sessions for all children during the afternoon. Children from four years of age participate in a programme designed to support their transition to school. Children have opportunities to explore areas of interest and learn related literacy and numeracy skills.</p><p>Children up to two years of age are catered for within a responsive and caring environment. The babies and toddlers room encourages children to develop physically and emotionally and explore their surroundings safely.</p><p>Teachers implement useful planning and assessment procedures for children to extend their interests by offering a variety of activities. Teachers evaluate the effectiveness of these activities regularly and modify or change the programme as appropriate.</p><p>Teacher’s professional learning is aligned to outcomes of the centre’s self review, and to areas identified through the owner’s participation in local ECE networking. The majority of teachers are yet to achieve full registration and are supported to meet the registered teacher’s criteria through mentoring from fully registered staff.</p><p>The owners have implemented good quality self-review procedures that ensure improvements are sustained. Owners are implementing good quality practices for the employment, performance management and ongoing professional development of teachers.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>In order to build on the good quality practices at the centre, centre owners and ERO agree that their next steps for learning include:</p><ul>
<li>further developing useful strategic planning by including all areas of operation and ongoing development of curriculum areas</li>
<li>strengthening the usefulness of assessment practices by including more formative assessment processes</li>
<li>documenting children’s ongoing learning by identifying their dispositions and using them to increase the complexity of their play</li>
<li>increasing teachers’ capabilities and awareness of bi-cultural and multicultural practices.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kidz Unlimited (Learning Centre) Ltd completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve practice the owners should consider external appraisal to meet teacher registration requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kidz Unlimited (Learning Centre) Ltd will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>18 October 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
