<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Lollipops Educare Half Moon Bay in Auckland is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children through effective leadership, management, curriculum and teaching practices.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Lollipops Educare Half Moon Bay provides all day education and care services for children through to five years of age. The centre is divided into five separate rooms to provide for infants, toddlers and older children. Currently, forty percent of children attending are Chinese and another forty percent are New Zealand European. Children from a range of other ethnicities also attend the centre.</p><p>The centre is part of the Lollipops Educare group of early childhood services. It operates under the comprehensive management systems that support all Lollipops Educare centres. A new centre supervisor was appointed in 2012. This is the first ERO review of the centre which opened in 2009.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><p>Teachers provide infants with individual care and attention in an emotionally safe and nurturing environment. Infants have a sense of wellbeing and belonging. Teachers are responsive to children&rsquo;s non-verbal cues and encourage language development through repetition of oral language.</p><p>Toddlers and older children settle quickly and confidently into play. They form trusting relationships with teachers. Children enjoy opportunities to learn in the context of child-initiated play. Teachers work alongside children and prompt their participation in the programme. They are increasingly responsive to children&rsquo;s ideas. ERO affirms teachers&rsquo; use of children&rsquo;s home languages to support their learning and sense of belonging.</p><p>Self-review has been effectively used to enhance indoor learning environments. All five rooms are stimulating, attractive and well-resourced. As a result, children are now focused and engaged in the programme. They make good use of equipment to enhance their learning.</p><p>Leadership is effective. Centre managers model positive and inclusive leadership practices. They are committed to ongoing progress and open to feedback. This approach contributes to a culture of improvement and the development of an enthusiastic, motivated teaching team. Centre managers have identified useful next steps to guide continuing centre-wide development.</p><h3>Areas for development and review</h3><p>ERO and managers agree that self-review processes could be used more effectively to enhance teaching practices and strengthen newly implemented planning, assessment and evaluation systems. Managers and teachers could:</p><ul>
<li>increasingly recognise opportunities to support children&rsquo;s independent learning in the context of play and during centre-based routines</li>
<li>expand bicultural and multicultural aspects of the programme</li>
<li>continue to develop understandings about child-centred planning and ways to extend children&rsquo;s interests</li>
<li>enhance individual assessment records by documenting children&rsquo;s progress over time and involving parents in the assessment of children&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>evaluate the programme to show how the curriculum and teaching practices are impacting on children&rsquo;s learning.</li>
</ul><p>Managers and teachers could develop long-term centre goals and evaluate the impact of these goals to identify improved outcomes for children.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Lollipops Educare Half Moon Bay completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.&nbsp;</p><p>Makere Smith</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region (Acting)</p><p>21 September 2012</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col><col><col></colgroup>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><p>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></html>
