</table><p>Lollipops Parnell is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Lollipops Parnell operates in the ground floor of a business complex. The centre is licensed for 60 children, including up to 24 under two years of age, and provides full-day education and care. Children are grouped according to age in three rooms. The youngest children have a playground designed to cater for their needs. The two older groups share a playground.</p><p>The centre serves a diverse community. The teaching staff, some of whom are qualified, reflect some of the nationalities of families. Many of the present staff are long-term relievers. The centre manager is working with personnel from Evolve Education Group to generate a full teaching team.</p><p>The manager, staff and whānau cooperated in updating the centre philosophy statement. The statement spells out the aims and aspiration for all. It highlights the focus on cultural recognition with an emphasis on te Tiriti o Waitangi principles.</p><p>The 2016 ERO report recognised good practices in supporting children's play through conversations and positive interactions. Relationships in the centre were affirming and respectful. These practices generally continue to be evident. The report also commented about areas for improvement, including the philosophy, strengthening assessment practice and using internal documents to guide improvement. All of these suggestions are being enacted.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 10 reviews in the Evolve Education Group.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are generally settled and have developed relationships with teachers and each other. They independently access resources that are available to them and display a sense of ownership and belonging, particularly in the outdoor spaces.</p><p>The new philosophy statement highlights the inclusion of bicultural learning in the programme. Teachers are successfully using te reo me ōna tikanga as part of everyday interactions and practices. Children demonstrate understanding and some skill in using Māori kupu appropriately. They are also supported to use their home language, and teachers share cultural festivals and celebrations with whānau. Leaders model the inclusive intent of the philosophy and ensure teachers are able to access professional development.</p><p>Recent improvements in the Kiwi room for infants and young children have created a friendly, warm and inviting space for play. Children access resources independently and make good use of the covered outdoor area to explore the activities provided for them. Support personnel from Evolve are working in conjunction with the centre manager to continue to develop learning environments across the centre.</p><p>Teachers plan programmes based on their observations of children's play. Learning stories in children's portfolios indicate teachers' good knowledge of children. The newly created daily diaries in each room have had a positive impact on providing interesting programmes for children. It would be timely to review the programme structure for older children and allow them more time to actively pursue their strengths and interests. Teachers could then plan a programme to help children develop working theories as part of play.</p><p>The recently appointed centre manager has a strong vision for high quality provision for children's learning through play. This could be appropriately supported with deeper engagement with <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum. Practical support from the Evolve Area Manager and Teaching and Learning Development Manager should enable these developments.</p><p>Relationships with whānau are a strength in the centre. Whānau comment favourably in digital and paper portfolios about the time their children spend in the centre. They contribute knowledge and time to assist teachers and are eager participants in family and cultural events in the centre.</p><p>Despite the lack of permanently appointed staff, teachers are beginning to form teaching teams in their rooms. This is a positive start to generating a sense of ownership and collegiality to support consistency across the centre. The recent internal evaluation about the philosophy was a good process that led to drawing staff and parents into a shared process.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre management agree that the key next steps for the centre are to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continue with plans to build staff capacity, confidence and knowledge</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>undertake a thorough review of resources with a focus on children's use of and learning from environments, including challenge for older children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>use <em>Te Whāriki</em> to strengthen teachers' implementation of quality programmes.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Evolve Education Group senior managers have agreed that key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>ensuring the company's vision and values, goals and principles reflect the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>addressing staffing issues in some centres to ensure quality teaching practices are evident</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reviewing how effectively the levels and quality of learning resources in centres promote collaboration amongst children and promote more complex thinking</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>providing professional learning and development for leaders and teachers to ensure a deeper engagement with <em>Te Whāriki</em>.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Lollipops Parnell completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practice, Evolve Education Group senior managers must take steps to ensure that health and safety policies and procedures are implemented rigorously across all services.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services (Northern)</p><p><span>Northern Region - Te Tai Raki</span></p><p>19 December 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
