</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Creators @ Home - Waikato Rua is part of a national organisation that owns a range of early learning services. This network is based in Hamilton. It provides three models of support; ‘At Home’, where educarers care for children in private homes, ‘Awhi', for caregivers of children up lifted from their families by Oranga Tamariki, and ‘Awhi Whānau', for whānau caring for the children of family members. The majority of children in this network are supported by the 'Awhi' model. The service receives standard funding from the Ministry of Education and is licensed for up to 80 children from birth to school age. The current roll of 29 includes 11 children of Māori descent.</p><p>Educarers provide education and care programmes in homes. Visiting teachers provide support, educational oversight and leadership for educators. Regular playgroup sessions for educarers and children are hosted by visiting teachers. They are fully qualified and registered early childhood teachers.</p><p>The organisations philosophy aims for children to be provided with loving, respectful, exciting and inviting learning environments that foster their holistic development. Four Pillars guide service operations and practices they are, love and connection, nature play, the Reggio Emilia learning model and value-based learning.</p><p>This is the first review of this network, previously known as Footsteps. Creators Education Trust, a not for profit organisation purchased Footsteps in September 2015.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The services philosophy, vision, goals and systems effectively promote positive learning outcomes for all children. The clear and shared vision of ‘children deserve our very best’ and the service’s philosophy are highly evident in systems and practices at all levels of the organisation. An appropriate range of regularly reviewed policies provide clear guidelines and expectations. These are underpinned by concepts of children’s rights, equity, social justice, advocacy for children and acknowledgement of Māori as tangata whenua. The strategic intent is focused on improvement and includes appropriate plans, actions and resourcing.</p><p>Leaders and visiting teachers effectively build capability within the service with a focus on promoting positive outcomes for all children and their whānau. Relationships at all levels are based on respect, trust and reciprocity. Leaders and visiting teachers have established a culture in which children and their whānau are first and foremost, valued and affirmed. They are strong advocates for quality and accessible in-home education and care for children. Robust frameworks, processes and practices have been established for self review and professional collaboration, sharing and critique of practice.</p><p>There are well defined and shared expectations and guidelines for service operations. Quality resources and the induction of educarers support them to meet the organisations expectations and legislative requirements. Visiting teachers work closely with educarers to provide safe environments, while offering challenge and opportunities for children to be creative, make choices and explore.</p><p>Visiting teachers have established productive partnerships with parents, whānau, educarers and external agencies. These partnerships have been instrumental in removing barriers to a child’s full acceptance, participation and learning. Recent professional learning and development has focused on respectful practice for children up to two years of age. This emphasis has reinforced the importance of responsive care and continuity of home practices and routines for babies.</p><p>The curriculum is effectively designed to promote positive outcomes for individual children. Visiting teachers are knowledgeable about current theories and approaches in early childhood education and care. They use this knowledge well to co-construct a broad curriculum that reflects the service philosophy, values and <em>Te Whāriki</em>. Visiting teachers champion learning through play, care for papatuanuku and maximising children’s learning in homes and the wider community. Children experience authentic opportunities that motivate their curiosity and connections with people, places and things of significance to them.</p><p>Assessment systems and practices promote children’s identities as successful learners. This approach reflects their interests, strengths and learning dispositions over time. Assessment information is central to curriculum planning and is shared with parents and whānau.</p><p>Visiting teachers effectively implement and model practices that promote positive learning outcomes for children. They provide individualised support, coaching and mentoring that builds educarers knowledge and capability. Regular contact includes in-depth conversations with educarers, to identify children’s interests and strategies to deepen children’s learning and thinking.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Agreed priorities for ongoing internal evaluation for improvement include continued review and refinement of:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>procedures for appraisal that include targeted planning for professional learning and development for visiting teachers and educarers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the current focus on the services commitment to the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi and bicultural practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continued development of the Creators @ Home bicultural curriculum and practices that more specifically reflect Māori perspectives, and practices that acknowledge and build on Māori children’s cultural capital.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>In addition, an important consideration for the service is to create opportunities for parents and whānau to contribute to the service’s strategic direction and the development of a localised curriculum.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Creators @ Home - Waikato Rua completed an ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Creators @ Home - Waikato Rua will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p><span>Te Tai Miringa - Waikato / Bay of Plenty Region</span></p><p>20 June 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
