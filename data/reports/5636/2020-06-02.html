</table><p>Kaitake Kindergarten is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kaitake Kindergarten provides early childhood education and care for up to 40 children over two years of age. The current roll is 64, including four Māori children. All teachers are fully qualified.</p><p>The philosophy emphasises parents as valued and a vital part of the learning process.</p><p>Kaitake Kindergarten is one of 24 kindergartens operating under the governance and management of Kindergarten Taranaki (the association). The association’s vision is ‘enriching learning’. The governing board is responsible for setting the overall direction for the organisation. Oversight of the association is the role of the current acting chief executive. The acting chief executive is supported by a team of managers and leaders. There have been a number of changes in leadership and management personnel in the past three years.</p><p>Since the previous ERO review, the head teacher and most of the teaching team at Kaitake Kindergarten are newly appointed.</p><p>Key next steps for the association, identified in the January 2017 ERO evaluation, continue to be priorities. Strengthening appraisal, partnerships with whānau Māori, including children's cultures in assessment documentation and review and evaluation were key next steps for the kindergarten. There has been progress in most of these areas.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of seven kindergartens in Kindergarten Taranaki.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Warm, inviting and trusting relationships between children, teachers and whānau are fostered. Children confidently communicate, lead their learning and demonstrate a strong sense of belonging. Teachers skilfully promote learning experiences for children and build on opportunities to extend their knowledge and thinking. Children have a responsive curriculum that promotes <span lang="mi">kaitiakitanga,</span> science, mathematics, literacy, <span lang="mi">te ao Māori</span> and physical exploration.</p><p>Kindergarten Taranaki assessment guidelines effectively inform teaching and learning practices. Planning for individual children highlights their interests, preferences and strengths and include parents and whānau contributions and aspirations.</p><p>Māori success as Māori is upheld through increased <span lang="mi">te reo me ngā tikanga</span> rituals and practices. Māori children's identity as Māori is celebrated. Whānau Māori input and expertise are valued by the kindergarten as a learning community. Promoting all children's culture, language and identity in planning for learning processes is an area for ongoing development.</p><p>Well considered systems and practices are in place to support children's diverse learning needs.</p><p>The association has identified that a priority is to strengthen educationally powerful partnerships with whānau. A range of information and reporting is shared with whānau and surveys are undertaken to gather their views. Evaluating the effectiveness of current communication and consultation strategies should contribute to the association progressing this priority.</p><p>Teacher appraisal and professional development are growing practice and effectively promoting positive outcomes for children. The association board maintains a deliberate focus on strengthening Kindergarten Taranaki capacity and capability to support educational success for Māori learners. Teachers have accessed professional learning to build their Māori knowledge and understandings of their place and learning community.</p><p>Teachers are well supported to build their understanding and use of evaluation for teaching improvement. Targeted support to enhance understanding of aspects of evaluation should continue to drive improvements for children’s learning. Having a clear focus for each evaluation is a key next step, so that actions needed are identified and given priority.</p><p>Systems for recording and monitoring health and safety requirements were implemented in 2018. Further rigour and monitoring is required to ensure oversight of ongoing compliance accountability is maintained. Priority should also be given to the consistent implementation of a policy review schedule.</p><p>Board members show a good understanding of their governance roles and responsibilities. Strategic direction and annual planning align and guide the organisation. Reporting to the board by association leaders has been recently strengthened. Evaluating progress and outcomes of the strategic plan and further refining reporting to the board should continue to enhance decision making.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps for the kindergarten are to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>meaningfully include all children's culture, language and identity in assessment, planning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>use effective internal evaluation to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Kindergarten Taranaki should;</p><ul>
<li>
<p>consistently implement a policy review schedule and strengthen effective monitoring of accountability systems and processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>enhance reporting to the board to include assurance of accountability, the quality of teaching and learning and outcomes for children’s learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>systematise and strengthen processes used to evaluate progress of the strategic plan.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>Priority should be given to sustaining a systematic process that assures governance and management of ongoing compliance accountability.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kaitake Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve practice, Kindergarten Taranaki should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>finalise the development of lockdown procedures to further guide kindergarten practice statements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthen the review of accident, illnesses and incident records and implementation of practices as required.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>To improve compliance practice, Kaitake Kindergarten should:</p><ul>
<li>ensure that equipment that could topple or fall and cause injury is secured.</li>
</ul><p><em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, HS6]</em></p><p>Since the onsite visit the service has provided ERO with evidence that shows it has addressed this non-compliance.</p><p>Darcy Te Hau</p><p>Acting Director Review and Improvement Services (Central)</p><p>Central Region - <span lang="mi">Te Tai Pūtahi Nui</span></p><p>2 June 2020</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout <span lang="mi">Aotearoa</span> New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework <span lang="mi">Ngā Pou Here</span> is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and <span lang="mi">Ngā Pou Here</span> refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
