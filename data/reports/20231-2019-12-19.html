</table><p><span>Lollipops North Harbour Fantails </span>is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Lollipops North Harbour Fantails provides full-day education and care for children in two adjacent buildings. Children aged up to two-and-a-half years of age are in the Kiwi building, and those up to three-and-a-half are in the Fantails building. Another building for older children, Lollipops North Harbour Kakapos, is situated across the road. Each building has a separate outdoor area. Children are from diverse cultural backgrounds. A small number have Māori or Pacific heritage.</p><p>This centre was previously known as Kids Inn Nursery &amp; Fantails. It was purchased by Evolve Education Group (EEG) in 2014. Visiting personnel from EEG support the centre in its day-to-day operations, long-term planning and development projects.</p><p>Centre leaders include a manager, and two head teachers who are new to their roles since ERO's previous review. Seven other qualified teachers and six unqualified staff complete the teaching team. The centre's philosophy promotes respectful relationships with whānau. Te Tiriti o Waitangi and <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, are acknowledged as guiding documents.</p><p>Key next steps identified in ERO's 2016 report included developing teachers' knowledge of te ao Māori and ensuring assessment and planning processes reflect <em>Te Whāriki</em>. Progress has been made in these areas.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of ten reviews in the Evolve Education Group.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children in the Kiwi group are very well supported by high quality interactions with teachers. They have a strong sense of belonging in the centre. Teachers ensure that routines are calm, unhurried and respectful. They recognise and quickly respond to children's non-verbal cues. Teachers use very effective strategies to support children's oral language development.</p><p>Children in the Fantails group have frequent opportunities to participate in experiences that challenge their thinking and curiosity. They make choices and confidently direct their own play and learning. Children work together well in small groups and interact positively with teachers and other children. Routines foster their self-help skills and independence.</p><p>Teachers use karakia and waiata as part of daily routines. They have a commitment to increasing their use of te reo Māori. Children have many opportunities to share aspects of their own cultures and to experience the languages and cultures of other families at the centre.</p><p>Teachers have developed shared understandings about the practices that empower young children. Their consistent and enabling approaches support children to engage in the curriculum as confident and capable learners. The Kiwi and Fantails environments are attractive and thoughtfully presented to promote children's exploration, imagination and creativity.</p><p>Assessment and planning systems are highly effective. Teachers know each child's strengths and interests, and skilfully analyse their learning and progress. They use a range of strategies to gather parent feedback. Teachers are increasingly writing about how they respond to the learning aspirations that parents/whānau have for their children. They could now improve how they evaluate children’s progress towards identified learning goals.</p><p>The manager works collaboratively with teachers to progress the centre's long-term goals for improvement. A robust process for staff appraisal is well implemented and supported by targeted professional development. EEG has established an effective process for centres to implement internal evaluation. Both teaching teams undertake in-depth reviews that result in improved provision for children. An EEG framework of policies and procedures guides centre practices. This framework continues to be reviewed.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps include teachers:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>increasing opportunities for children to hear and speak te reo Māori in meaningful learning contexts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evaluating the impact of their teaching practices on improved outcomes for children.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Evolve Education Group senior managers agree that key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>ensuring the company's vision and values, goals and principles reflect the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>addressing staffing issues in some centres to ensure quality teaching practices are evident, promoting positive outcomes for all children and ensuring sustainability of quality practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reviewing how effectively the levels and quality of learning resources in centres promote collaboration amongst children and promote more complex thinking</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>providing professional learning and development for leaders and teachers to ensure a deeper engagement with <em>Te Whāriki</em>.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Lollipops North Harbour Fantails completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>To improve current practice, Evolve Education Group senior managers must take steps to ensure that health and safety policies and procedures are implemented rigorously across all services.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services (Northern)</p><p><span>Northern Region - Te Tai Raki</span></p><p>19 December 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
