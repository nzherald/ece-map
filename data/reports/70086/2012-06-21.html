<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</span></h2><p>Mayfield Playcentre is one of eight playcentres managed by the Mid Canterbury Playcentre Association. The association provides the framework and support for the operation of the centre. The parents and supervisors are responsible for the daily management of the centre and the programme provided for children. High child to adult ratios are maintained at mixed-age sessions.</p><p>Mayfield Playcentre provides good quality education and care for children. Centre wh&#257;nau work effectively together. They make good use of the playcentre systems and practices to share responsibilities, and acknowledge and use individual strengths. They successfully build an in-depth knowledge of each child. They skilfully use this information to support the child and the family within the playcentre and the wider community.</p><p>Children participate in well organised programmes that allow them to choose from a wide range of activities and resources. Centre wh&#257;nau help the children to use the resources in a range of ways to develop their ideas and creativity. The structure of the programme allows parents to spend considerable time with their own children. A feature is the friendship and support that parents provide for each other.</p><p>The centre has made significant improvements and development to the building and the outside environment since the 2009 ERO report.</p><p>Association personnel provide a good range of support and training to the supervisors and parents. They help parents ensure the centre maintains a high level of health and safety. They provide programmes and guidance to help supervisors and parents develop the skills, knowledge and confidence to successfully manage the centre and promote positive learning outcomes for all children.</p><p>ERO, the association managers and centre wh&#257;nau agree that the next steps for improving children&rsquo;s learning includes:</p><ul>
<li>making better use of self review, child assessment and planning to identify, plan for and monitor improvements to children&rsquo;s learning</li>
<li>increasing understanding, knowledge and pride in New Zealand&rsquo;s bicultural heritage among the children and their families.</li>
</ul><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. To reach these findings ERO evaluates:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how governance and management determines the service&rsquo;s vision/philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how the leadership and capability of all involved, including educators, enhances positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is implemented to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning reflect diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of partnerships with wh&#257;nau and self review. ERO evaluates how well placed the centre is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at Mayfield Playcentre.</p><h3>How well placed is Mayfield Playcentre to promote positive learning outcomes for children?</h3><h4>Context</h4><p>Mayfield Playcentre is located in a small rural community that has a high concentration of dairy farming. New families with young children find the playcentre a social and supportive place to meet, make friends and improve their parenting skills.</p><p>The playcentre philosophy states that the centre operates as a parent cooperative where parents are recognised as the child&rsquo;s first and best educator. The family unit is valued, promoted and supported. Each child is accepted, nurtured and provided with a stimulating and creative environment. <em>Te</em> <em>Tiriti o Waitangi</em> is reflected in the centre environment and culture.</p><p>This review was conducted as part of a trial of ERO&rsquo;s revised approaches to reviews in early childhood education services. The trial used a cluster approach for the reviews of eight playcentres within the Mid Canterbury Playcentre Association umbrella organisation.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p>Children and parents benefit from positive and affirming relationships with each other. Children confidently approach any parent, who knows them by name, for assistance or to share experiences. Children warmly greet each other, play cooperatively and respect individual differences and opinions. Centre wh&#257;nau take pride in their relationships with and the progress of all children. Parents told ERO that they particularly enjoy the time that playcentre provides for them to spend uninterrupted time with their own child.</p><p>Centre wh&#257;nau work effectively together. They make good use of the playcentre systems and practices to share responsibilities, acknowledge and use individual strengths. They successfully build an in-depth knowledge of each child. They use this information to support the child and the family within the playcentre and the wider community.</p><p>Individual children&rsquo;s interests are accurately identified through parent knowledge and the detailed observations that the supervision team records. Well structured discussions before and after the session clearly direct the supervision team in ways to extend these interests.</p><p>Children participate in a well organised programme that allows them to choose from a wide range of activities and spend the time that they need to develop their ideas. Centre wh&#257;nau have high expectations for children&rsquo;s learning and behaviour.</p><p>Centre wh&#257;nau carefully listen to and help the children to use the resources in a range of ways to extend their interests. The supervisor and some parents make good use of questioning and time to help children solve problems, explore and be creative.</p><p>A number of parents are making effective use of the playcentre parent education programme to continue to improve their skills with and understanding of children. These parents told ERO that the modelling by association personnel and other parents who are more advanced in the training influenced their decisions. Participation in the training programme is helping to ensure the playcentre is sustained and learning outcomes for all children continue to improve.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p>ERO, the association managers and the parents agree that the next steps to improve children&rsquo;s learning include:</p><ul>
<li>making more consistent use of the training and guidelines for self review provided by the association to improve children&rsquo;s learning opportunities</li>
<li>making better use of the child observations (learning stories) to identify the learning occurring for each child and the ways that adults can extend this learning further</li>
<li>developing an understanding and inclusion of te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori in consultation with families of M&#257;ori children and the wider M&#257;ori community</li>
<li>making closer links between the strategic plan, self review, supervisor appraisal and training to strengthen sustainability and capacity at association and centre levels.</li>
</ul><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p>Before the review, the staff of Mayfield Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement</em> and <em>Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
