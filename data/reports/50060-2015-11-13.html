</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Khandallah Ngaio Community Creche is a community-based early childhood service catering for children from 18 months to school age. Most enrolled children are aged between two and three years and attend one to three sessions per week. For many it is their first early childhood education experience outside the home. The majority move on to other early childhood services prior to starting school. A number of families are from non-English speaking backgrounds.</p><p>A committee made up of parents undertakes the governance role. Responsibility for day-to-day operation is delegated to a non-teaching manager.</p><p>The philosophy emphasises the importance of play-based learning, caring and respectful relationships, and partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>The centre has a positive reporting history with ERO.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Values expressed in the centre philosophy are evident in practice. A child-initiated, play-based programme is in place. Relationships between teachers and children are warm, responsive and respectful.</p><p>Teachers engage well with children to support their learning and social development. The calm tone of sessions is maintained. Children are confident and independent learners. Many persevere in their self-chosen activities for sustained periods.</p><p>The programme is well resourced and organised to support children’s learning. There is a range of opportunities that supports creativity and imaginative play. Literacy, mathematics, science and the arts are integrated into the programme in the context of play and everyday happenings. Children have opportunities to make choices that are enjoyable and meaningful for them.</p><p>Teachers show commitment to the development of a bicultural perspective in the programme and to strengthening their understanding of te ao Māori. They regularly reflect on their skill in weaving te reo and aspects of tikanga Māori into the programme.</p><p>The team has begun to seek ways to improve its response to Māori learners. New resources have been accessed to develop understanding of Māori values. Teachers have plans to strengthen links with whānau and local iwi in order to define success for Māori learners in the context of the centre. Accessing recent Ministry of Education publications to increase their competence in working with Māori learners is a next step.</p><p>Teachers continue to reflect on ways they can better support learners of Pacific heritage. An increased range of resources is planned to support children’s learning and teachers’ practice.</p><p>Suitable practices are in place to support children’s transitions into and out of the service. These are flexible and focused on children’s wellbeing. Teachers agree that next steps should include developing closer relationships with other local early childhood services and primary schools to promote the sharing of information about children and support further planning for transition.</p><p>Children aged under two years are well cared for. Their learning is supported by an appropriate range of experiences, resources and equipment. Older children are encouraged to support those younger.</p><p>Teachers have identified children with additional learning needs as priority learners. They regularly and collaboratively reflect on their development and progress. Specialist help is accessed when necessary.</p><p>A responsive and inclusive approach to planning for learning is developing. This incorporates parents’ input and ongoing consideration of children’s progress in relation to their family’s aspirations for them. Portfolios record aspects of children’s participation in the programme and learning over time. These documents should be strengthened through the inclusion of all data collected about individual children’s progress and by limiting assessment to only that information that is significant for each child. Including information that shows how teachers are adding breadth to children’s learning should also enhance their use as records of progress.</p><p>The manager effectively promotes collaboration and shared decision making. Teachers are highly committed to the philosophy and kaupapa of the centre. They work cohesively to support learners and ensure expectations for their practice are met. An air of positivity is evident.</p><p>Appraisals support teachers to reflect on aspects of their practice. These should be further developed to include well-defined goals and constructive feedback linked to identified needs and the strategic priorities of the centre. They should also include evidence showing how professional teaching requirements are being met. For the manager, a robust process that identifies professional development needs should be put in place. The approach to facilitating induction and mentoring for beginning teachers needs further development.</p><p>Improved outcomes for children result from teachers’ self review. Further work should be undertaken to strengthen understanding and use of self review for improvement. Defining the values articulated in the philosophy should support a review of practice in relation to agreed priorities.</p><p>Members of the parent committee are highly committed to the vision and philosophy of the service. Regular meetings support collaborative discussion about finances, policies and events. The strategic plan comprehensively outlines priorities linked to teaching and learning, community relationships and management of the service. The quality of governance and management should be strengthened by:</p><ul>
<li>the identification of actions and desired outcomes to facilitate progress towards strategic goals</li>
<li>and to form a basis for monthly meeting reports from the manager</li>
<li>integrating strategic priorities into teachers’ and the manager's appraisals</li>
<li>reviewing aspects of financial management and reporting</li>
<li>developing guidelines for governance and management to support sustainability , review and further development of roles.</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The manager and teaching team should continue to develop the:</p><ul>
<li>response to Māori learners and whānau through the programme</li>
<li>approach to assessment</li>
<li>team’s understanding and use of self review for improvement</li>
<li>teacher appraisal process and induction and mentoring programme.</li>
</ul><p>The manager and parent committee should further develop the:</p><ul>
<li>manager’s appraisal process</li>
<li>quality of some governance and management practices.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Khandallah Ngaio Community Creche completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Khandallah Ngaio Community Creche will be in three years.<img src="assets/index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" alt="" title=""></p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>13 November 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
