</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>ABC Dinsdale is located in the Frankton suburb of Hamilton. It caters for 90 children, including a maximum of 34 children up to two years of age. At the time of this ERO review 126 children were enrolled, including 44 children identified as Māori and 4 children identified as Pacific.</p><p>The service has experienced changes to management and teaching staff since the 2012 ERO review. The learning environments have been reviewed. The preschool and ‘kinders’ rooms have been amalgamated, resulting in increased interactions and communication between three and four-year-old children and their teachers. There is also greater contact between babies and toddlers, while a quiet area is available for infants. A specialised indoor area is being used to support children’s art and enable them to work on projects over time. The spacious outdoor environments have been redeveloped to give children more experience of the natural world.</p><p>The centre continues to operate under the umbrella of Kidicorp Ltd which provides strong and effective governance, leadership and management support. This includes well-developed and rigorous self-review and quality assurance processes, and professional, administrative and business support by well-qualified and experienced personnel.</p><p>The service has made positive progress in further developing aspects of practice identified for improvement in the 2012 review.</p><p>Teachers have had regular access to professional learning and development opportunities as individuals as well as group occasions. The centre manager has undertaken a leadership course, teachers have attended a regional conference, and teachers of children up to two have reviewed their care practices to reflect up-to-date research.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children in each of the groups are trusting, and settled in their age-appropriate environments. They are highly engaged in learning. Children have many choices of meaningful activities that provoke curiosity, creativity, and exploration. Toddlers and young children play cooperatively, developing friendships and social skills. They are encouraged to make decisions, solve problems and be independent. They enjoy imaginative play, and often include teachers as participants.</p><p>The playgrounds encourage active physical play involving climbing, riding bikes, digging and playing with water. Children are learning to appreciate the natural world, and take responsibility for watering gardens and caring for pets. Groups of children are highly involved in expressive dancing as a form of self-expression. Children up to two years of age play and learn in a peaceful, calm, child-led environment where relationships with adults are caring and respectful.</p><p>Teachers have very good relationships with children, and know each child and their families well. Teachers spend time sharing information with parents, and respond to the aspirations they have for their children’s learning and development.</p><p>Teachers listen to children, and often hold extended conversations that explore and extend their learning. They are skilled at supporting and advocating for children with diverse learning needs, including children with special needs. Transitions between learning areas are well-managed according to the individual needs of children and their parents. Regular walks to visit nearby schools enable children to be familiar with school routines and environments.</p><p>Teachers plan their learning programmes in response to children’s interests and parents’ aspirations. They include a focus on strands and goals from <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and also include an emphasis on:</p><ul>
<li>multicultural and bicultural values and knowledge</li>
<li>appropriate physical, intellectual and social skills and knowledge.</li>
</ul><p>Literacy, numeracy and science are naturally integrated throughout the daily learning experiences. Teachers provide parents with information about how they can support children’s learning and their transition to school. Children’s stories and art work are prominently displayed in the centre. Teachers prepare the environments to provoke children’s interest.</p><p>Teachers have reviewed their assessment practices. They have a good understanding of the purpose of assessment to identify and deepen the complexity of children’s learning. Individual assessments provide valuable information about learning, and are included in portfolio books. These are available to children and their parents to share. Online portfolios encourage parents and families to celebrate children’s learning, and share their home learning experience. Teachers are able to respond appropriately to this timely information about current interests and the ideas they may bring to the centre. Six-monthly summary reports and parent interviews provide a platform for parents and teachers to share and discuss this information and develop goals for ongoing development.</p><p>Teachers and leaders use a well-developed process of self review to focus on improvements to the centre programme and operation. There is a strong commitment to including Māori perspectives along with tikanga and te reo Māori in authentic and meaningful ways. Professional development with an external provider is assisting the centre to review and develop its literacy programme to reflect current best practice.</p><p>Effective centre leaders promote the vision and values of the Kidicorp umbrella organisation. They have established a cooperative working environment where teachers are able to use their strengths and take on leadership roles. Staff have benefited from Kidicorp’s emphasis on developing capable, well-informed leaders. The appraisal system is focused on improving practice and outcomes for children. Monthly meetings between the senior centre leader and individual teachers contribute to the effectiveness of appraisal in improving teaching practice.</p><p>Well-planned, self-review initiatives continue to focus teachers’ attention on planning and assessment, intentional teaching practice, and the development of parent partnerships. Te reo Māori is more evident in the programmes, and there is a commitment to increasing the bicultural curriculum.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre leaders agree that the following next steps for development should be to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen the use of assessment for programme planning and to identify intentional teaching strategies</li>
<li>include the perspectives of parents, whānau and children in self review</li>
<li>develop the integration of bicultural practice, in consultation with local iwi.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of ABC Dinsdale completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of ABC Dinsdale will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>4 March 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
