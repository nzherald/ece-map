</div><div class="WordSection3">
<p>Prebbleton Nursery and Education Centre is one of three centres in Prebbleton owned and operated by the same managers.&nbsp; This centre caters for babies and children up to three years old. &nbsp;The staff are nearly all qualified early childhood teachers.&nbsp; Many have worked in this centre for a number of years.</p>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">Infants and toddlers receive good quality education and care.&nbsp; They enjoy warm and nurturing relationships with their teachers.&nbsp; Parents are actively encouraged to share information and to participate with their child in the programme.&nbsp; ERO observed infants and toddlers who were confident and happy in the centre&rsquo;s environment.</p>
<p class="ReportText">Teachers actively promote children&rsquo;s independence, language development and participation through the wide range of activities provided.&nbsp; The inclusion of te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori is a feature of the programme.</p>
<p class="ReportText">Staff work well together and make good use of their individual strengths to support each other and children in the programme.</p>
<p class="ReportText">The managers, and ERO agree, that the next step is to develop a vision that focuses on high quality learning and teaching.&nbsp; This includes making more effective use of self review, child assessment and planning to identify and improve outcomes for children.</p>
<p class="ReportText">The centre has appropriate systems and procedures to provide children with a safe and healthy environment.</p>
<h3 class="MSHeading2">Future Action</h3>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children.&nbsp; Therefore, ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p>
<a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2>
<h3 class="MSHeading2">The Focus of the Review</h3>
<p class="ReportText">Education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive outcomes for children. To reach these findings ERO evaluates:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mana Whakahaere &ndash; how governance and management determines the services&rsquo; vision/philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou&#257;rahi &ndash; how the leadership and capability of all involved, including educators, enhances positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is implemented to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning reflect diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul>
<p class="ReportText">Within these areas, ERO considers the effectiveness of partnerships with wh&#257;nau and self review. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at Prebbleton Nursery and Education Centre.</p>
<h3>How well placed is Prebbleton Nursery and Education Centre to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">Prebbleton Nursery and Education Service is well placed to provide positive outcomes for children.&nbsp; More effective use of self review, assessment and planning could improve the learning outcomes for all children.</p>
<h4 class="MSHeading3">Background</h4>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">The philosophy states that the centre will provide a nurturing and caring environment that reflects New Zealand&rsquo;s bicultural heritage.&nbsp; The programme will be stimulating and fun.&nbsp; Teachers and parents will work together to promote children&rsquo;s well-being and learning.<b></b></p>
<h4 class="MSHeading3">Areas of strength</h4>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">Infants and toddlers enjoy positive, nurturing relationships with their teachers.&nbsp; Teachers know the infants and toddlers well and make good use of this information to respond appropriately to children&rsquo;s interests and needs.</p>
<p class="ReportText">Teachers warmly welcome parents.&nbsp; They encourage them effectively to share meaningful information and join in the programme to help their infants and toddlers settle.</p>
<p class="ReportText">Teachers encourage infants and toddlers to be independent.&nbsp; They carefully listen to children, give them time to respond and respect their choices. &nbsp;Routines are well integrated into the programme and used effectively as teaching opportunities.</p>
<p class="ReportText">Children&rsquo;s social skills are actively promoted.&nbsp; Teachers use a wide range of strategies to help children understand the feelings of others and to include them in their play.</p>
<p class="ReportText">Te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori are included naturally in the programme.&nbsp; Some teachers make good use of te reo M&#257;ori in their conversations with children and during group times.&nbsp; ERO observed infants and toddlers responding well and enjoying these sessions.</p>
<p class="ReportText">Some teachers actively build children&rsquo;s thinking and problem-solving skills through their questioning and the ways that they share information and ideas.</p>
<p class="ReportText">Children are active explorers within their environment.&nbsp; Teachers provide a good range of activities, particularly creative and physical equipment.&nbsp; This equipment is regularly rearranged by adults and children to challenge and promote children&rsquo;s physical development.</p>
<p class="ReportText">Teachers work well together.&nbsp; They effectively utilise individual strengths and support each other within the programme to promote children&rsquo;s learning.<b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<h4 class="MSHeading3">Areas for development and review</h4>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">The managers and ERO agree that the next steps to improve learning and teaching include:<b></b></p>
<ul>
<li>developing a vision and long-term direction for the centre that focuses on high quality learning, teaching and curriculum implementation</li>
<li>developing a better understanding and more effective use of self review to continue to improve outcomes for all children</li>
<li>teachers making greater use of assessment to identify children&rsquo;s learning and linking this information more effectively in the programme plans, teaching approaches and programme evaluations.</li>
</ul>
<a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">Before the review, the staff of Prebbleton Nursery and Education Centre &nbsp;completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist.&nbsp; In these documents they have attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures.&nbsp; ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p>
<ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul>
<a id="4-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Future Action</h2>
<p class="ReportText1stPara">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children.&nbsp; Therefore, ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.&nbsp;</p>

<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p class="ReportText">Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s &nbsp;self review.</p><h3 class="MSHeading2">Review Focus</h3><p class="ReportText1stPara">ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><b>Quality of Education</b> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><b>Additional Review Priorities</b> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review.&nbsp; ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><b>Compliance with Legal Requirements</b> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.<b></b></li>
</ul><h3 class="MSHeading2">Review Coverage</h3><p class="ReportText1stPara">ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues.&nbsp; The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3 class="MSHeading2">Review Recommendations</h3><p class="ReportText1stPara">Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement.&nbsp; A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue.&nbsp; There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
