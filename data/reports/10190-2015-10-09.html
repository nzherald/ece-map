</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Glow Kids provides specialist education and care for children with multiple and complex disabilities. Children who attend the centre participate in tasks designed to strengthen their physical capabilities and support the development of their language and thinking skills.</p><p>The centre is licensed for 25 children and currently has six children on its roll. It offers full day and sessional options for families. The centre has a high adult-to-child ratio to support children’s physical and learning development. The outdoor environment is due to be upgraded and will include a sensory exploration area.</p><p>The centre’s philosophy is strongly aligned to the Glow Kids vision of providing a place where every child has the opportunity to reach their greatest potential. A significant undertaking since the 2011 ERO report has been the blending of the Conductive Education principles and practices with the goals of with <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum.</p><p>The centre’s experienced and dedicated staff are a blend of Hungarian trained conductors, an occupational therapist and an early childhood trained teacher. Currently one staff member holds both Conductive and New Zealand qualifications and has full teacher registration with the Education Council. Parent, family and caregiver involvement is essential to the effective implementation of the programme.</p><p>Glow Kids is part of the New Zealand Foundation of Conductive Education. There have been changes in ownership and in the centre management structures since ERO’s 2011 review. The service currently operates under the GlowKids Trust: a charitable organisation, led by parents. The centre was previously known as IRIS Conduction Education. Managers and staff have responded positively to recommendations in the 2011 ERO report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children receive high quality care and are settled and happy. They are warmly welcomed by staff. Children’s emotional wellbeing is nurtured and their successes are celebrated. Whānau highly value the respectful relationships their children experience with staff. Positive partnerships and clear communications between families and caregivers continue to be a strong feature of the centre.</p><p>Children are familiar with routines. Staff have clear expectations for children and work collaboratively to provide consistency in teaching practice. Staff and caregiver interactions are calm and purposeful. They provide positive guidance that allows children to be successful in their learning.</p><p>Teachers encourage children to explore their surroundings and are responsive to their interests. To personalise learning, teachers assess each child and build from what they know about the child’s interests and abilities. Parents' and carers' aspirations are used to inform children’s learning and development programmes. This teacher and parent collaboration supports the complex learning needs of each child.</p><p>Children are given leadership opportunities and are encouraged to interact with each other. The diverse activities and equipment available are designed to broaden their experiences and provide challenges.</p><p>Staff successfully promote biculturalism as a teaching focus through resources, displays, group time activities and festive celebrations. Te reo me ngā tikanga Māori are successfully integrated into the programme in meaningful ways to encourage children’s understanding.</p><p>The indoor learning areas have purpose-built rooms which support the programme well. Children’s health is supported through maintaining a high degree of cleanliness. Teaching children to self manage their own personal care needs is an integral part of the daily programme.</p><p>Very good systems are in place so that teachers can monitor each child’s progress towards clearly outlined goals. Children’s learning plans and assessment records show their individual progress and include information about their next learning and developmental steps. Attractive portfolios capture children’s learning experiences in the centre, and are useful for discussions between teachers and families about learning progress.</p><p>Staff provide good support for families and children during transition to school. Meetings with whānau, school leaders, specialist support personnel and staff from the centre are carefully planned over a period of time to help children settle into school.</p><p>Staff work well to support each other. Professional development for all staff helps to improve outcomes for children. The centre promotes shared leadership among the staff.</p><p>The centre manager has established good systems for operating the centre. The manager and staff use self review as an effective tool to improve all aspects of the service. The centre is currently reviewing teacher appraisal systems to align with other nationwide Conductive Education Centres’ processes.</p><p>The centre manager and head teacher are seeking ways to sustain the centre by building roll numbers and increasing public of awareness the centre’s specialist service. They are also exploring ways to retain Conductive Educators in order to maintain the distinctive philosophy and character of the centre.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre manager and head teacher agree that the next steps for the centre are to:</p><ul>
<li>document outcomes against the annual plan and evaluate progress towards strategic goals</li>
<li>evaluate the effectiveness of teaching plans and how they impact on the achievement of children’s learning outcomes.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Glow Kids completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Glow Kids will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>9 October 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
