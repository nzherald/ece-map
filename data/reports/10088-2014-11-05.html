</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Akoteu Falemasiva provides education and care for up to 30 children from babies to five years of age. Children up to two years of age are cared for in a separate learning environment. They have opportunities to interact with the older children for specific activities. This full day service has a history of good ERO reports. Leaders have responded well to the recommendations for improvement made in the 2011 ERO report.</p><p>Akoteu Falemasiva promotes Christian values and delivers programmes to support children’s Tongan language development and their culture and identity. The centre is situated on the property of the Free Church of Tonga and is one of two licensed centres. It is governed by parent, teacher and church representatives who form the Management Committee. The service is led by early childhood trained centre managers. They work closely with the management committee to provide centre direction. Leadership roles and responsibilities within the service are identified.</p><p>Management supports teachers to gain qualifications and registration as teachers. There is a focus on promoting and supporting younger teachers to gain qualifications to ensure the sustainability of the service.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children’s strong sense of Tongan identity and belonging is well supported by the centre. Children connect culturally and relate well to each other, to teachers, and to their learning environment. They participate actively in the programme and are free to explore independently, select resources and make choices about their play. Teachers provide some opportunities for children to develop independence and to take responsibility for their own learning.</p><p>Parents are able to participate in and contribute their ideas to strengthen their children’s learning. Teachers and parents work more closely together to strengthen the quality of children’s learning because of parents’ active participation in parent-teacher meetings. Teachers cater for parents who are fluent in the Tongan language as well as those who are learning the language.</p><p>Teachers communicate in a variety of ways with parents about the service and the learning programmes. They are using information technology (IT) effectively to build partnerships with parents. They intend exploring how to use IT to enhance and extend children’s learning.</p><p>The centre’s culturally responsive programme embraces the rightful place of tangata whenua. Te reo and tikanga Māori are being promoted through the bicultural curriculum. Children enjoy waiata, karakia and welcoming visitors to their centre.</p><p>Teachers are improving how well they assess and plan for children’s learning. They notice, recognise and respond to children’s individual interests and document their findings in attractive child-focused portfolios. They discuss and plan collectively for individual and group learning, incorporating children’s cultural and prior knowledge. <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, guides the programme.</p><p>Teachers are developing a better understanding of the ways in which children learn and are working more closely with parents to support children’s progress. Learning at Akoteu Falemasiva is valued and celebrated through ceremonies that include parents, whānau and the extended community.</p><p>Teachers have developed a self-review process that has resulted in improved practices over time. Centre managers and teachers constantly review the effectiveness of the centre’s programme. They are aware that space can be used more effectively to enable children to access their learning and develop their independence. They are supported to build their professional knowledge through collegial discussions and by attending workshops.</p><p>The management committee consists of church, parent and centre representatives with expertise. This group provides direction and good governance for the centre. The committee is well established in the community and works collaboratively with the centre manager. Active and responsive leadership is demonstrated through regular monthly meetings and clear documentation including meeting minutes.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre managers acknowledge that to continue to improve outcomes for children, they need to use self review to:</p><ul>
<li>develop a strategic plan, along with an annual plan, that documents the centre’s priorities to support the centre to achieve its vision</li>
<li>research and extend the quality of children’s learning in the transition to school programme</li>
<li>enhance children’s learning opportunities and independence in the indoor and outdoor environments.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Akoteu Falemasiva completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Akoteu Falemasiva will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>5 November 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here</a>:</li>
<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
