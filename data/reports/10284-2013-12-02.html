</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>First Steps Grey Lynn was last reviewed by ERO in 2010. The centre was known as ABC Grey Lynn at that time. In late 2012 the Kidicorp organisation became the new service provider and the name of the centre was changed to First Steps Grey Lynn. The centre is licensed for 42 children, including 18 under two years. The services are flexible, allowing children to attend full-time, part-time or for four hour sessions.</p><p>The centre is organised into two separate areas to suit children of different age groups. Children transition to the older group at about two and a half years. Both areas are sunny and spacious with large outdoor areas. The off street parking and surrounding trees contribute to the centre’s private and attractive setting. Parents who live and work near the city find the centre’s location very convenient.</p><p>The past twelve months have been a period of significant redevelopment for the centre. Priorities were set and self-review audits were carried out at all levels of operation. Health and safety systems have been improved and the indoor and outdoor play areas considerably enhanced. New equipment has been carefully selected to strengthen programme goals.</p><p>The improvements have been made with the capable support of Kidicorp business and professional services managers. They have appointed new staff, implemented up to date policies and procedures, and recently selected a new centre manager to sustain and further develop the quality of the services.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children’s wellbeing and learning are central to the centre’s new philosophy and programme. Teachers create a home-like environment that encourages social interactions and learning through play. The menu provided for children is nutritious and well planned. Physical activity, imaginative and creative play is supported by high quality equipment that is accessible to both younger and older children.</p><p>Children are confident and active participants in the programme. They explore the centre environment and make good use of the attractively organised areas of play. The programme is free flowing and uninterrupted by routines. Children make decisions about their participation in individual and group play. Literacy is strongly promoted throughout the environment, through activities, and in conversations between children and teachers.</p><p>Children engage positively with one another and make friends. They are supported to take leadership roles and to act responsibly and kindly. Teachers encourage children’s self-help skills and independence. The environment for infants and toddlers is calm and settled and well suited to their developmental needs. Teachers in the under two area are gentle and reassuring as they invite children to explore learning in physical and sensory ways.</p><p>Teachers are developing an emergent curriculum that is focused on noticing and responding to how children play and learn. They are respectful of children’s needs and recognise their different interests. The Kidicorp professional learning programme is helping the teaching teams to develop a shared understanding of good planning and assessment in relation to the centre’s new philosophy.</p><p>Teachers are exploring ways to extend bicultural components of the programme. Some teachers are modelling the use of te reo and tikanga Māori for others. The environment could reflect more of these approaches, and children’s cultural backgrounds and home languages could be better documented to support teachers’ cultural responsiveness.</p><p>Parents and whānau are very welcome in the centre. Teachers encourage parent involvement and record their comments and feedback. The use of children’s portfolios to show children’s learning progress is developing. Centre managers are also considering ways to personalise the care records of younger children so that parents have more ready access to daily information.</p><p>Teachers have contributed to developing a new centre philosophy. Management systems and support for staff have improved considerably. The recent appointment of an office administrator allows the new centre manager to be the centre’s educational leader. Time spent with teachers evaluating practice is valuable in building reflective teaching teams and strengthening self review.</p><p>Kidicorp has appropriate long-term plans to continue the positive development of the past year. The well designed appraisal system that is being implemented this year has the potential to strengthen teacher reflection and inquiry. With the continued support of the Kidicorp Professional Services Manager and the Business Manager, the new centre manager is well placed to sustain centre improvements.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre managers agree that the next stage of development should focus on:</p><ul>
<li>implementing a readiness for school programme that supports children and parents with the process of transitioning from the centre to school</li>
<li>continuing to strengthen the use of self review to evaluate programme planning, assessment and evaluation</li>
<li>ensuring that the programme for older children encourages complex and sustained play.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of First Steps Grey Lynn completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>First Steps managers have prioritised the review of all health and safety procedures and provided training for staff relating to the 2008 ECE licensing criteria.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of First Steps Grey Lynn will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>2 December 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
