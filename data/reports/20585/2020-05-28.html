</table><p>Kids Biz Preschool and Daycare is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kids Biz Preschool and Daycare is a privately owned, family-focused centre in Browns Bay, Auckland. The service operates in a converted house with a mixed-age group of infants, toddlers and older children. The service caters for a small number of Māori, Chinese and children from other cultures, as well as a large number of Pākehā children.</p><p>The centre’s philosophy places a high value on the importance of <span lang="mi">whanaungatanga</span> and <span lang="mi">tuakana/teina.</span> It encourages children to become lifelong learners, fostering mutual respect, social responsibility and a strong partnership between home and the centre.</p><p>The 2016 ERO report identified many areas of good practice and these have been maintained. Agreed next steps and identified areas of non-compliance have been addressed. Since the 2016 ERO review, teachers have participated in significant professional learning. As a result, there have been positive developments in teacher practice.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>A focus on <span lang="mi">whanaungatanga</span>/family connections is strongly evident in the centre. Children and parents are warmly welcomed. Children readily settle to play and confidently choose from a variety of play opportunities in the environment. They have opportunities to engage in sustained play and to work together with their peers. These opportunities help to promote <span lang="mi">tuakana/teina</span> relationships and a strong sense of belonging.</p><p>Teachers foster positive relationships with children, and many children have established friendships. Teachers display nurturing relationships with children under two, who have opportunities to play in their own area. These younger children may interact with their older peers, developing their curiosity and exploration. Children's language is developed through increased conversations with teachers.</p><p>Older children can sustain their play that often extends across a range of play areas. Those nearing five years of age are encouraged to practise their self-managing skills in preparation for transition to school.</p><p>Teachers reflect on their own practice to improve outcomes for children. Their organised approach for individualised programme planning is based on children's personal interests and parent aspirations. Learning goals are responsive and modified through the programme to better support children's evolving learning. Portfolios present records of children's participation in the centre and foreground their learning dispositions.</p><p><span lang="mi">Tikanga and te reo Māori</span> are included in the environment and promoted through <span lang="mi">pōwhiri, karakia</span> and<span lang="mi"> waiata,</span> and at meal and mat times. Displaying phrases to use more regularly would help to grow teacher confidence and capability.</p><p>The centre's philosophy is a guiding document for the centre. The strategic plan would be strengthened by aligning the strategic goals to this philosophy.</p><p>An experienced and well-qualified management team provides strong leadership. Teachers are respected and valued for their strengths. Managers continue to grow centre-wide leadership. Leaders and teachers make good use of external expertise to support their internal review processes and professional learning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders agree that next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continuing to strengthen internal evaluation capability across the centre</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>carrying out an in-depth review of how well the physical environment and resources support children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increasing <span lang="mi">te ao Māori</span> and Pacific cultures and languages throughout the programme and physical environment.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kids Biz Preschool and Daycare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services (Northern)</p><p>Northern Region - <span lang="mi">Te Tai Raki</span></p><p>28 May 2020</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout <span lang="mi">Aotearoa</span> New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework <span lang="mi">Ngā Pou Here</span> is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and <span lang="mi">Ngā Pou Here</span> refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
