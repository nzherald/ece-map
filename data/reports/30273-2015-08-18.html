</tr></tbody></table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>The Treehouse on Ranolf is a privately owned all-day education and care centre located in Rotorua. The centre is licensed for 38 children, including up to 16 children under two years old. At the time of this ERO review, the roll of 46 included six Māori children, along with a small group of children from Samoan, Indian, Filipino, Czech and Sri Lankan families.</p>
<p>The centre is governed by the owners and centre manager who together have responsibility for strategic direction, financial management and staff management. The centre manager has responsibility for day-to-day management and professional leadership.</p>
<p>The centre occupies a formerly residential property, which provides spacious indoor and outdoor areas, including designated spaces for children under two. Older children have a larger space with easy access to equipment and facilities including an all-weather outdoor learning area. There are well-established, flexible procedures to ensure children and families transition smoothly between age groups and to school.</p>
<p>The centre has a positive reporting history with ERO. Since the 2012 ERO review, staffing has been consistent. The centre has a commitment to employing permanent teachers who are either qualified or undertaking training as early childhood education teachers. Over 80% of teachers are currently qualified.</p>
<p>The centre’s philosophy emphasises child-led learning, social skills development, the environment as the third teacher, and developing children’s awareness of bicultural and multi-cultural perspectives. These values are continually reflected in the daily programme and in the positive relationships between teachers and children. A calm, settled and family-like atmosphere is evident throughout the centre.</p>
<h3>The Review Findings</h3>
<p>Children continually benefit from very respectful interactions and responsive teaching. They contribute to designing the daily programme and leading their learning. Teachers effectively tune into children’s play, skilfully extend their learning, challenge their thinking, and encourage problem solving. Sustained discussions provide learners with very good opportunities to develop oral language skills, including subject specific vocabulary and te reo Māori. Flexible routines include options for children to engage in social, independent, quiet or active play. Use of computers for investigation and revisiting learning is well considered and meaningful.</p>
<p>Infants and toddlers are very well nurtured and cared for in a settled, home-like environment. A strong emphasis on consistent staffing ensures that infants establish warm relationships with their teachers, who maintain a personalised approach to respecting children’s individual rhythms and routines. Home partnerships are sustained through daily communication about children’s learning and development needs. Teachers encourage children to enjoy playing in the outside natural environment, and foster oral language development by speaking to children about their play and care routines. Infants and toddlers have many opportunities for exploration in both indoor and outdoor areas. Teachers maintain a calm, slow pace in which young children have space and time to lead their learning.</p>
<p>Indoor and outdoor environments are attractively resourced to support children’s learning through a range of play activities, investigations and physical challenges. Teachers continue to develop the environment using natural materials and gardens that reflect environmental sustainability and bicultural influences. Literacy, mathematics concepts, science, music, construction and creative expression are integrated into children’s play.</p>
<p>The child-led programme encourages children to develop a love of learning within a positive social environment. Teachers place high value on children’s knowledge and heritages. The centre manager and teachers continually review practices and the programme in the light of current research and best early childhood education practice. Reviews result in positive improvements for children, and teachers have a strong focus on strengthening partnerships with families.</p>
<p>Programme planning is very effectively based on systematic and comprehensive assessment, which has been recently strengthened by a deliberate focus on recognising children’s learning dispositions and using bicultural assessment practices. Individual assessment records continue to include comments from children and demonstrate the progressive development of their strengths and interests over time. Learning and planning are summarised in individual development plans, and biannual interviews. These form the basis of reporting to parents and includes them as partners in their children’s learning. The programme for four year olds extends children’s learning within their current play and investigation interests.</p>
<p>The centre continues to be very well governed, led and managed by the owners and centre manager. Together they promote collaborative and shared responsibility for centre leadership according to teachers’ strengths and interests. Teachers model positive working relationships within a professional learning culture. The detailed strategic plan has an explicit bicultural component and continues to provide a strong sense of purpose and direction for the centre. Progress in relation to the strategic plan is monitored through the year. In-depth self review continues to be a feature of the centre. Strategic, regular and spontaneous reviews are well analysed to inform decisions about continual improvements for children.</p>
<h3>Key Next Steps</h3>
<p>ERO and centre managers agree that the centre’s next steps are to continue to implement positive changes revealed by ongoing rigorous self review. Identified areas for planned development are to:</p>
<ul><li>further strengthen partnerships with parents</li>
<li>continue to refine appraisal processes according to recent professional learning and development.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3>
<p>Before the review, the staff and management of The Treehouse on Ranolf completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p>
<h3>Next ERO Review</h3>
<p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p>
<p>The next ERO review of The Treehouse on Ranolf will be in four years.</p>

<p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here:</a></p>
<ul><li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p>
<p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p>
<p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p>
<p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p>
<h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3>
<p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p>
<ul><li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
