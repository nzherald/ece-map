</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Bright Beginnings Early Childhood Centre - Forrest Hill has been managed by the current owners since April 2013. The centre director, who is one of the owners, works closely with the supervisor to manage and improve the centre. The staff team includes four qualified teachers and a cook. Teachers provide full-day education and care for children from birth to school age.</p><p>Children are grouped according to age in two separate rooms and share the outdoor playground. Many children attend for the full day. Children and teachers are from a variety of ethnicities and cultural backgrounds.</p><p>The centre’s philosophy is based on <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and is inspired by the education ideas of Reggio Emilia. The philosophy focuses on the importance of positive relationships and high quality interactions, respect for children and providing a stimulating environment that encourages exploration and self discovery.</p><p>Since ERO’s 2012 review, the owners have made improvements to all aspects of centre management and operations. The owners are aware of the need to continue to develop teachers’ understanding of their expectations and approaches to teaching and learning.</p><p>This review was conducted in conjunction with the owners’ second centre in Glendowie.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their families have warm and affectionate relationships with teachers. Children are gently guided to make choices from a range of activities prepared for them. Most children settle easily into the routines and rhythms of the day, enjoying the company of others and the attention of teachers.</p><p>Teachers talk to children consistently during the day. Frequent conversations are a mark of good practice. The programme for the younger children is intended to be play-based, with an emphasis on their growing independence and self management. Teachers should strengthen the programme by allowing children more opportunities to explore and enjoy uninterrupted time to play.</p><p>Teachers have worked hard to meet parents’ expectations of more formal learning for older children in preparation for school. Parents express their satisfaction with the programme. This trust should allow teachers to provide opportunities for children to learn naturally about the foundations of reading, writing, and mathematics as part of meaningful play. They could also continue to remind parents of the value of play as a way of learning.</p><p>The centre’s resources to support a Reggio Emilia inspired programme have been increased. Areas of play are arranged to engage children’s interest and provide opportunities for them to challenge themselves. An example of this is the outdoor area, which has new climbing resources and a strong focus on children’s individual physical skills. Children are confident and adventurous in their outdoor play.</p><p>Teachers observe children’s play and write stories about their learning. Planning to date has been loosely based on children’s interests and teachers’ ideas of linking these under a shared programme project. Children’s individual portfolios include many entries that illustrate children’s participation in the group programme. Teachers should now consider ways to identify and record individual children’s interests, and plan programmes that support them to follow these interests.</p><p>Teachers have been provided with professional development to help them gain confidence in providing a bicultural curriculum. Teachers use te reo Māori phrases with children and sing waiata. They take care to observe some Māori protocols in the programme. This has been an important improvement in the centre.</p><p>Policy and procedural frameworks guide the operation of the centre. Systems for monitoring health and safety have been developed and implemented. Strategic and annual planning, and appraisal systems, have been established with a view to aligning all documentation. Part of this alignment will be the development of a new philosophy agreed between owners and teachers, and in consultation with families.</p><p>Teachers have begun to use self review as a tool to evaluate the programme. It would be useful now for teachers to focus self review on their own practice as a way of making decisions about how to improve the effectiveness of programmes and outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre owner identified with ERO, the following next steps for the centre. They include: </p><ul>
<li>redeveloping the philosophy with a stronger focus on working with children and on the inspiration of Reggio Emilia</li>
<li>having a clear focus on developing teaching practices to reflect teachers’ growing knowledge of current good practice and co-construction of learning with children</li>
<li>continuing to strengthen bicultural practices in the centre. </li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Bright Beginnings Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Bright Beginnings Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>3 July 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"> ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
