</table><p>Active Explorers Melville <span>is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</span></p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Active Explorers Melville, formally known as Clever Kids Early Learning, is located in the Hamilton suburb of Melville. It is licensed for 110 children, including 30 up to the age of two years. The centre provides all-day education and care for children from birth to school age, in four age-based areas. The centre caters for families from a diverse range of ethnic backgrounds and for many English is an additional language. The current roll of 113 includes 34% of children who identify as Māori and 12% of Indian descent.</p><p>The centre is one of six in the Waikato governed by Evolve Education Group (Evolve). A recently appointed teaching, learning and development manager and a new area manager provide support to the centre manager and teaching team. Nine of the 11 teachers in the centre have an early childhood qualification and two have primary school qualifications. Four staff are in training and two are unqualified.</p><p>The centre’s philosophy states they provide a safe, holistic environment where children feel empowered and are encouraged to take risks. A place where children’s cultures are acknowledged and valued. Teachers aim to build partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>Since the last ERO report in 2016, Evolve has restructured, with significant personnel changes at all levels. There have also been significant changes to the teaching team at Active Explorers Melville, however, the centre manager has remained the same. In addition, there has been a reconfiguration of both the indoor and outdoor environments.</p><p>The centre has made considerable progress towards addressing the key areas for development identified in the 2016 ERO report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their whānau experience a welcoming and inclusive environment. Teachers form responsive and reciprocal relationships with whānau. They understand the child in the context of their family and community, providing a good foundation for learning and development. Responsive relationships support children’s sense of belonging.</p><p>The curriculum effectively responds to the interests of children to promote educational success. Māori and Pacific children, and those for whom English is an additional language, are clearly identified. The centre has begun to utilise the skills and knowledge of current staff to grow teachers’ cultural responsiveness. Children’s independence and self-management are actively encouraged through responsive and flexible routines. Children make choices and decisions about their play and are involved in the daily routines of the centre. Teachers plan events and celebrations that acknowledge and value the many languages and cultures of children and their whānau. Learning conversations between teachers and children support oral language development. The reconfiguration of the learning environment has increased opportunities for children to mix with different age groups promoting their social and emotional competence. Transitions into, through and beyond the centre are well-managed, flexible and responsive to individual needs.</p><p>Children and their whānau have access to well-presented individual learning portfolios, including an on-line format. Parents’ aspirations and dispositions are integrated into this recently developed assessment process. There is a need to strengthen individual assessment, planning and evaluation informed by specific learning outcomes from <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the Early Childhood Curriculum.</p><p>There is a well-considered approach to supporting children with additional needs and individual plans support their learning and development. Teachers liaise with external agencies to support these children and their whānau.</p><p>Children up to the age of two years benefit from nurturing teaching interactions in a calm and caring environment. Children benefit from unhurried interactions that follow routines and aspirations of parents and whānau.</p><p>The centre manager has a strategic approach to building staff capability to improve outcomes for children. Professional learning and development for teachers is linked to centre priorities and teachers' appraisal. A new shared philosophy and vision reflects the priorities of the centre community.</p><p>Internal evaluation is embedded across the centre and is leading to positive changes for children. Policy review is completed in consultation with staff, parents and whānau. Further considerations should be given to strengthening alignment between appraisal goals and the centres strategic direction to better support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Governance needs to be strengthened. Evolve is in a phase of restructuring and rebuilding and the organisation's vision and values are currently under review. Policies, procedures and systems at the governance level require systematic review to ensure they meet legislative requirements.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Evolve must ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>there are suitable systems in place, that are monitored, to ensure that governance meets the regulatory requirements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>processes that support teachers to know the expectations of the service and build their practice are put in place.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Active Explorers Melville completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Central</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>24 September 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
