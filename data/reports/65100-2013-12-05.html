</table><p>The Rabbit Patch Preschool – Airport is <em>well placed</em> to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The Rabbit Patch Preschool – Airport Centre is located in the airport grounds and is one of three early childhood centres in Christchurch with the same owners. The three centres are strongly influenced by the philosophy of Reggio Emilia.</p><p>The Reggio Emilia philosophy makes significant use of the environment as a way of extending children’s learning. Teachers provide children with a balance of structured and free-choice learning experiences that are appropriate for their needs.</p><p>The centre provides for employees at Christchurch International Airport and from the wider community. The buildings are purpose built. The nursery, toddler and preschool areas each have their own separate, well-resourced indoor and outdoor learning environments.</p><p>The teachers are fully qualified. They have a commitment to make ongoing improvements to the programme and practices through self review. The teachers are learners alongside the children.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The philosophy is an important part of how this service operates. The Reggio Emilia approach is highly evident in the set up of the environment and the way the programme is planned to build on children’s interests and wonderings.</p><p>Children, parents, whānau and families are warmly welcomed into the preschool. There are respectful, positive, and nurturing relationships among children and teachers, and parents and teachers.</p><p>The centre has developed strong links with its parent community. Teachers make frequent use of parent expertise in the programme. Parents contribute in many ways to the programme, fostering positive relationships and effective involvement in their child’s learning and development.</p><p>Babies and toddlers in the under-two area experience respectful, caring relationships with their teachers. They are well supported in their language development and are provided with a wide range of learning activities. Teachers notice what children are interested in and let them take the lead in their learning. They provide a wide range of practical activities to develop children’s confidence and social skills.</p><p>In all areas of the preschool, teachers support children’s learning in literacy and numeracy. Teachers respond to and follow children’s interests. They change learning activities to provide new, varied and stimulating experiences for children, particularly in science and group play. Children are well supported to develop positive social skills. Teachers integrate some te reo and tikanga Māori into the learning programme.</p><p>Children play in well-planned, purposeful spaces that make good use of the natural environment and resources. Children benefit from playing with equipment that can be used in a variety of ways to foster their exploration and curiosity.</p><p>Journals about individual children’s learning show that teachers know children, their strengths, and their interests well. Teachers make good use of what they notice about children’s interests to identify how they will extend learning for each child and groups of children. Teachers meet regularly to discuss children’s learning. Managers provide teachers with clear guidelines for planning.</p><p>The centre has in place a range of useful practices to help teachers work together in identifying what is working well and what could be improved (self review). Teachers follow clear guidelines to help them record their self-review process.</p><p>The centre is well led and managed. A feature of the centre is the effective management systems and support for staff. Managers have well-developed long-term plans that focus on improvement over time. Managers have high expectations for what effective teaching and learning should look like. They provide regular, well-targeted and purposeful opportunities for teachers to extend their skills and knowledge.</p><p>The centre managers of the three Rabbit Patch Centres have regular opportunities to provide leadership and support to each other. They make good use of their strengths and skills to develop consistent practices and promote improvement. The manager of this centre role models effective practice within the programme.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Managers have made good use of self-review processes to identify appropriate areas for continued improvement. They have identified that they need to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>the teacher appraisal system to ensure their high expectations for teaching are met consistently. This is likely to help some teachers to increase the ways they help children think, share their ideas and problem solve</li>
<li>aspects of self review by including children’s perspectives more, increasing teachers' abilities to lead aspects of self review, and ensuring that the outcomes of self review are evaluated and revisited.</li>
</ul><p>ERO has identified that other next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>strengthening assessment by developing further ways to incorporate parents' perspectives on their children’s learning, more consistently show how children’s learning has progressed and deepened over time</li>
<li>promoting Māori children’s cultural identities.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of The Rabbit Patch Preschool - Airport completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of The Rabbit Patch Preschool - Airport will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>5 December 2013</p><h4>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h4><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col><col><col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
