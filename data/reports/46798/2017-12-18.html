</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The Secret Garden Huapai is a new service that provides sessional and full day education and care for up to 30 children over two years old. The centre is accommodated in a house that has been modified to provide a bright, open-plan environment, with easy access to an extensive outdoor area. Most enrolled children have Pākehā or European heritage, and a small group of children with Māori or other cultural backgrounds are also well supported in the centre. The centre's philosophy 'to support, affirm, encourage and challenge children to build their dispositions' is reflected in the programme that teachers provide.</p><p>The centre is managed by the owner and the head teacher. They work collaboratively to lead staff and guide the operation of the service. The centre has three registered teachers who are encouraged to participate in professional learning linked to their goals and the centre's development priorities. Teachers are becoming familiar with the new early childhood curriculum, <em>Te Whāriki 2017,</em> and are using <em>Tātaiako,</em> the guidelines for teachers' cultural competence, to enhance their practices.</p><p>This is the first ERO review of The Secret Garden.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre is a welcoming and inviting environment for children and their families. Children arrive with enthusiasm, and familiar routines help them to settle quickly and connect with their friends. They have very positive relationships with teachers, and respond well to adults' support for their play. Children are confident communicators. They collaborate well to play in small groups, and engage in reciprocal conversations. They know about making choices, maintaining a tidy environment, and being respectful towards others.</p><p>A specific programme to support older children with their transition to school is becoming increasingly focused on social competence rather than formal skills. This is a sound foundation for teachers to develop project work for these children and to add complexity to children's learning.</p><p>A large group of two year olds is well supported by a primary caregiver. A programme focus on manaakitanga and tuakana/teina relationships also ensures that older children are mindful of the different needs and capabilities of this youngest group.</p><p>Children benefit from the attractive, well-resourced environments. In particular, the large outdoor space with fruit trees, gardens, a water feature, a mud kitchen, and chickens provides many interesting options for learning. Children also enjoy more traditional resources such as the sandpit, climbing equipment, and water play. Currently, despite easy access, children do not move freely between the indoor and outdoor areas. They would take further responsibility for their own learning if this option was constantly available to children.</p><p>Teachers actively encourage children to engage with resources. They ask open-ended questions to foster children's ideas, and support them to explore their interests. Teachers have established a meaningful bicultural perspective in the programme, helping children to learn greetings, waiata, and karakia. They provide many opportunities for children to contribute to the programme and to develop self-management skills.</p><p>Centre leaders and teachers have established learning partnerships with parents. Teachers develop individual plans for each child focused on their learning dispositions. They invite parents to help identify goals for their children, and suggest strategies for learning. Most families readily contribute to this process, and are well informed about their children's progress. The challenge for teachers is to strengthen the links between children's dispositions and their interests to more effectively extend their learning experiences.</p><p>The centre is well managed. Leaders have made good progress in developing systems and documentation to operate the centre efficiently. They have developed annual and strategic planning that states clear goals aligned with the centre's philosophy. Leaders have established procedures for self review, and they continue to develop teachers' understanding of more robust internal evaluation. A recently implemented appraisal process is helping teachers develop their capacity to be reflective practitioners, and take responsibility for their own professional development.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders agree that key next steps for centre development should include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>developing connections between the centre's philosophy, strategic and annual planning, teachers' appraisal and professional development, to ensure that systems are clearly aligned and focused on positive outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>deepening the quality of teachers' reflections and evaluations in relation to self-review processes, their appraisal inquiries, and planning for children's learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>enhancing teachers' focus on children's individual interests, and using these to strengthen learning challenges, and extend the complexity of children's play.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of The Secret Garden Huapai completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of The Secret Garden Huapai will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>18 December 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
