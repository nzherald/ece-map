</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Curious Keas Ltd is a new privately-owned childcare centre opened in April 2012, located in the small King Country town of Piopio. It provides full-day education and care for children from three months to school age. The children are predominantly from families who have strong links in some ways to the rural community. The centre facility is a converted house and its surrounding section is leased from the local council. While there are separate indoor and outdoor areas for under two’s, the programme is flexible and allows many opportunities for children of all ages to play together. The centre is licensed for 35 children, including 13 under two years of age. The roll has grown steadily since it opened and there are 57 children currently enrolled, of whom 11 identify as Māori.</p><p>The centre owners provide the policy framework for personnel, financial and property management. One of the owners, who has early childhood qualifications, also fills the role as centre manager. She oversees daily operations, staff management and professional development. All current staff have an early childhood qualification and three are working towards full teacher registration.</p><p>The philosophy states the belief that children’s wellbeing and sense of belonging are very important and built within supportive relationships. It also indicates that children learn through fun-filled play.</p><p>This is the first ERO report for this centre.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children experience affirming and supportive relationships with each other and centre staff. Their social, emotional and physical needs are well met by responsive and caring staff. Familiar routines are centred around shared meal times and promote children’s social competence and confidence. Children are happy, settled and show trust in approaching adults for help or advice.</p><p>The extensive outside play environments include many natural features and allow children to engage in physical challenge and exploration. From time to time, the centre has young animals on site which children can interact with and care for. The inside play areas are well resourced. The flexible programme allows children to play independently with or alongside their peers for extended periods of time, and to make meaningful choices about activities to participate in. Children have opportunities to develop early literacy and mathematical skills, and to engage in creative and imaginative play. The local and parent community is used effectively as an additional programme resource for visits and excursions.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are well supported by primary caregivers, who take overall responsibility for each child’s care and education. These children play safely in their own areas. Many centre activities are naturally integrated and this promotes easy and relaxed transitions from the under two to the over two year old sections of the centre. Children and their parents are well informed through supportive relationships as they transition to the local primary schools.</p><p>Māori children and their whānau are affirmed through the inclusive culture and supportive relationships throughout the centre. Karakia and waiata are included in daily routines as appropriate, and children have attended the local schools’ kapahaka festival. Staff are aware of the need to increase their own knowledge and confidence in matters related to te reo and tikanga Māori.</p><p>Teachers work as a highly collaborative team. They meet formally and informally to share information about children’s interests and strengths, and to plan activities. Teachers have made a positive start in presenting well-illustrated individual portfolios for allocated children which reflect each child’s participation in the programme. Next steps for the leadership is to include a stronger child and parent voice in assessment portfolios, and create a useful link between these portfolios and programme planning and evaluation.</p><p>The owner/centre manager provides considerable enthusiasm, energy, and extensive local networks for the service. She articulates a positive sense of direction and purpose for the centre and her staff. Parents who spoke to ERO expressed confidence in centre leadership and staff, and felt that communication with them was open and effective.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the owner/manager agree that the centre’s philosophy for learning and teaching is the priority area for review and development. This review process will include:</p><ul>
<li>revisiting and clarifying the philosophy to develop in-depth understanding and shared ownership by staff and parents</li>
<li>the establishment of agreed expectations for staff about teaching and assessment practices, care routines and the consistent implementation of the centre’s policies and procedural guidelines</li>
<li>the development of the environment to ensure it supports the centre’s agreed approach to an emergent child-centred programme of learning</li>
<li>informed strategic decision making about staff and centre development, and resourcing.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Curious Keas Ltd completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Curious Keas Ltd will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>20 January 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
