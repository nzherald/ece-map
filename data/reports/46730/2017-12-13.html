</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Vital 5 Waimumu ECE in Massey, is a community based, not-for-profit service. It provides high quality education and care for infants, toddlers, and children up to five years of age. The centre is licensed for up to 75 children, including 18 up to the age of two years.</p><p>The centre has three indoor spaces that cater for different age groups. Younger and older children have access to separate outside learning areas. Māori children make up 17 percent of the roll, which also includes a group of Southeast Asian children and smaller numbers of other ethnicities. The cultural diversity among teachers reflects that of children and their families.</p><p>The centre is owned by the Lifewise Trust, an Auckland-based social development organisation. The trust is an arm of the Methodist Mission, and offers a variety of community services, including a small number of licensed early learning centres.</p><p>The centre's philosophy recognises Māori as tangata whenua and reflects the Lifewise Trust's ethos. The centre management team and staff have a strong commitment to supporting and working with families. Social justice and relationships are a key aspect of centre practices.</p><p>The centre manager, who is qualified, leads six qualified teachers and three non-qualified staff. A Lifewise service manager supports the governance and leadership of the centre, and in partnership with the centre manager, provides ongoing guidance to the teaching team.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers enact the service's philosophy in their teaching practices. They support children to learn through play in an attractive learning environment that is 'a home away from home'. Culturally responsive, respectful relationships and interactions underpin the centre's warm and welcoming tone. Parents value the centre's strong support for whānau.</p><p>Children are independent, have opportunities to lead, and participate in uninterrupted play. They are focused and highly engaged in their learning. Children are free to choose activities based on their interests and preferences. Friendships between children are well established. Children who require extra learning assistance are well supported. External advice is sought and used when required. Teachers have conversations with families to ensure that their children transition confidently through the centre.</p><p>Children up to the age of two benefit from caring teachers who promote a calm and peaceful environment. Care routines for younger children are individualised. Children have easy access to their own indoor and outdoor learning spaces, and they are able to explore and learn at their own pace.</p><p>Children demonstrate a strong sense of belonging. Teachers' interactions with children are respectful and affectionate. They work alongside children and are responsive to their ideas. Teachers build on children's understanding of the world around them in meaningful ways. They sensitively support children to develop social skills and a love of learning.</p><p>The carefully planned and attractive centre environments stimulate children’s interest, creativity, and involvement in the programme. Well defined areas of learning and good quality resources support children's play. Teachers' use of natural resources is a key feature that supports the centre's philosophy. Teachers implement <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum, well.</p><p>Children's individual portfolios show evidence of individualised programmes based on children's interests and parents' aspirations. Teachers use this information to plan learning experiences and skilfully integrate learning about mathematics, science, and literacy concepts into children's play.</p><p>Bicultural practices and te reo and tikanga Māori are integral parts of the centre. Pacific culture is also valued in displays and is evident in teachers' practice. Teachers use a range of very good teaching strategies and practices to respond to children's home languages and cultural identities.</p><p>The centre manager is very capable, and is well supported by the teaching team. Centre leaders provide very good guidance and support for new staff to ensure continued effective teaching practices are maintained. Teachers are highly reflective practitioners who continually seek ways to improve their practice. They enthusiastically engage in professional learning to enhance outcomes for children. Teachers' individual strengths and passions are valued, and contribute to the centre's high quality of education and care.</p><p>Useful systems and processes contribute to robust internal evaluation. This evaluation is both responsive and planned, and is supported by research. Evaluation is used to continually improve teaching practice and outcomes for children. The centre’s strategic plan is linked to the Lifewise Trust strategic plan. It is timely to develop strategic intentions and goals that are specific to the centre, to provide a clearer guide for its future development.</p><p>Lifewise Trust provides strong governance and management support for the centre, including a sound policy framework that ensures the health and safety of children and adults. The trust has a good working relationship with centre staff, and is supportive of initiatives that focus on strengthening partnerships with parents/whānau.</p><h3><span style="font-size: 1em;">Key Next Steps</span></h3><p>Centre leaders agree that key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>increasing opportunities for children to contribute to programme planning to support their own learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reviewing and refining the centre's strategic plan to guide future developments.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Vital 5 ECE Waimumu completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Vital 5 ECE Waimumu will be in four years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>13 December 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
