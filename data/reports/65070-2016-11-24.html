</table><p>An-Nur Childcare Centre is well placed to provide positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>An Nur Childcare Centre is one of two Muslim centres operating under the Al Noor Charitable Trust. The centre provides care and education for Muslim and non-Muslim children aged from birth to school age. It is the only Islamic early learning service in Christchurch. A sister centre has recently been opened in Dunedin.</p><p>The Christchurch centre focuses on upholding Islamic traditions and these are embedded into the centre's programmes. The multiculturalism of the teaching staff reflects the ethnic range of the children and their families. Diversity is valued and celebrated. Two of the teachers are qualified early childhood teachers and most of the other staff are working towards an early childhood qualification.</p><p>The centre's philosophy focuses on supporting children in the local and wider community. A centre van provides transportation for children who do not live locally. The centre manager is involved in the local learning cluster of schools.</p><p>Since the last review, there have been significant changes in staffing including new team leadership. Staff are making progress with the 2013 ERO review recommendations, specifically with assessment and planning.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers provide an inclusive environment with a strong focus on supporting children to interact respectfully with one another. Professional development opportunities for staff extend these understandings and create a sense of ako, learning from one another, including adults learning from children. This is especially significant for parents where English is not the first language. Teachers model care and respect for one another, the children and their families.</p><p>Children enjoy a wide range of interesting learning activities including the integration of science, mathematics and literacy. Children's language, culture and identity are highly valued. Teachers provide opportunities to hear and learn in the children's home language and to develop understanding and use of the English language.</p><p>Learning is based on <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum, and Islamic beliefs. Teachers are responsive to children's interests. Individual learning goals are identified and made visible in the learning environment. The centre manager has high expectations for teaching and learning, and has developed useful processes to support teaching staff to create meaningful learning.</p><p>The centre manager's in-depth understanding of internal evaluation means a culture of reflection and review is developing amongst the teaching staff. The centre manager encourages leadership capacity and a collaborative culture to ensure positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>Children under two years old benefit from warm, calm and responsive relationships. Teachers are responsive to individual needs and plan specific activities for these young children.</p><p>Informal and formal conversations are held with parents about their children's progress and learning goals. Teachers provide thoughtful and well-presented learning stories both digitally and in individual profile books to show learning over time. Opportunities are made for families to share their views and are encouraged to take an active role in the children's learning.</p><p>Social media is used to communicate with families and the wider community about activities and significant community events that the centre is involved in.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO has identified and the centre manager and team leader agree, that the next steps are to continue to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>understandings and use of in-depth internal evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>teacher appraisal processes to better align with the Education Council criteria for endorsing practising certificates</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>planning for children’s learning and teaching strategies in te reo and tikanga Māori in centre documentation and practices.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of An Nur Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of An Nur Childcare Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Te Waipounamu/Southern</p><p>24 November 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
