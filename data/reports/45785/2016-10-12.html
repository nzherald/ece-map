</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Building Blocks Community Kindergarten is one of three centres governed by the Building Blocks Community Trust. This Trust has a close connection to the South West Baptist Church. A centre director is responsible for the day-to-day running of the centres. Each centre has an onsite team leader who also provides daily leadership within the programme.</p><p>Since the 2013 ERO reviews, there have been many changes in staff. These include changes in team leaders, teaching staff and the establishment of a new position of curriculum coach who works across all the centres. The majority of staff are fully trained early childhood teachers.</p><p>The centre provides care and education for up to 30 children aged from two years.</p><p>The centres are involved in regular meetings with other local early childhood services and schools to promote collaboration and sharing of effective practices.</p><p>The centre has made good progress in meeting the recommendations of the 2013 ERO report.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of three reviews of the centres governed by the Building Blocks Community Trust.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The Christian philosophy is visible and evident in the environment and programmes.</p><p>Teachers promote effective relationships with children and families. Teachers have positive and learning-focused interactions with children. They help children think and talk about their ideas, play and choices. Children are supported to develop successful social behaviours.</p><p>Teachers provide a good range of activities and resources to support children’s learning. They set up interesting play environments that are purposefully linked to individual children’s interests, strengths and abilities.</p><p>Managers and teachers use a range of personalised practices to successfully support children with diverse needs and their families.</p><p>Teachers effectively incorporate aspects of te reo and tikanga Māori in programmes and practices. This has been an ongoing focus of self review and professional learning and development.</p><p>Managers have developed stronger systems and practices for building teachers' capacity. They have a good understanding of where teachers' strengths in teaching and learning are, and work to address issues when these arise. Teachers are provided with useful feedback to help them support children’s learning in more effective ways.</p><p>Managers have developed clearer guidelines and formats for planning and assessment. These are helping teachers focus more on being responsive to children’s individual interests and abilities. Useful guidelines for self review and teacher reflection constructively support teachers to increase their understanding of these processes.</p><p>Managers and teachers are making effective use of professional learning and development to improve aspects of practice and consistency across the centres. They have focused on growing centre leadership, especially at the team leader level, and establishing higher expectations for teaching and learning.</p><p>The Trust is now more involved in the governance of the centres. It has worked collaboratively with staff on the centre’s vision, mission and values.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre managers and ERO agree that the key next steps to improving outcomes for children’s learning include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>implementing consistent planning, assessment and self-review practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>using self-review findings to strengthen transition processes to support children as they move on to school</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening appraisal to build on and support teachers’ professional practice including reflecting on the effectiveness of their teaching</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>extending trustees', managers' and teachers' understandings of supporting success as Māori</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>more clearly defining key roles and responsibilities in leadership and strengthening strategic planning.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Building Blocks Community Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Building Blocks Community Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern</p><p>12 October 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
