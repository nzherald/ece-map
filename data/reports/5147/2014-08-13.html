</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Insoll Kindergarten is located in Hamilton and provides both all-day and sessional education and care for children from two years to school age. The kindergarten is licensed for up to 40 children over the age of two years at any one time. At the time of this ERO review, 47children were enrolled, of whom 25 are identified as Māori.</p><p>The kindergarten operates under the umbrella of the Waikato Kindergarten Association (WKA), which is a charitable trust, and does not operate for profit. The strategic direction of the association is guided by the overarching statement, ‘Every child reaching their full potential’. The WKA has a commitment to providing quality, inclusive services that effectively meet the diverse educational needs of all children attending. All kindergartens provide an <em>Enviro-School</em> focus as a key curriculum feature to encourage children to better understand caring for the environment.</p><p>The Educational Service Manager (ESM) monitors and reports to the association on the kindergarten’s quality of education. A kaumātua from Tainui provides advice, guidance and support about Māori language, culture and identity. The kindergarten’s administrative responsibilities are well supported by association resource personnel.</p><p>The kindergarten benefits from the WKA's clear guidelines and expectations for practice and the availability of good self-review processes for monitoring and evaluating the quality of education and care it provides for children.</p><p>The kindergarten head teacher and teachers have shared values for learning. They provide a vibrant, welcoming and inclusive environment. Tikanga Māori and the celebration of diversity are integral to the programme. Teachers, parents and whānau work in partnership to develop children’s self esteem, knowledge and skills to become independent life-long learners.</p><p>The kindergarten has a positive ERO reporting history. Since the previous ERO review, teachers have successfully addressed the recommended areas for review and development about strengthening bicultural practices and assessment and planning.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 12 kindergarten reviews in the Waikato Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Insoll Kindergarten is very well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>Respectful and trusting relationships underpin all aspects of kindergarten life. Children, parents and their whānau demonstrate a strong sense of belonging to the kindergarten community. The principles of the early childhood curriculum about empowerment, family and community, holistic development and relationships are strongly evident in practice.</p><p>Children enjoy an inclusive curriculum that supports them to experience success in an environment where their culture, language and identity are affirmed and valued, particularly for Māori. Te reo Māori and tikanga are naturally integrated into the programme. A standout feature of the kindergarten is the stimulating environment that motivates children to initiate their own learning and actively explore and investigate. Children can readily access high-quality resources and equipment to extend their imagination and be creative. The curriculum provides children with valuable and highly effective experiences in:</p><ul>
<li>literacy, mathematics, the arts, science</li>
<li>developing respect and understanding in caring for the natural environment</li>
<li>engaging in meaningful, sustained and complex learning</li>
<li>taking responsibility for themselves and others.</li>
</ul><p>Children’s communication and social development is fostered by the many opportunities to work collaboratively with their friends and support each other in their learning. Children are developing as confident and capable communicators and learners.</p><p>Children benefit from high-quality teaching interactions. Teachers notice children’s interests and are skilled at extending children’s thinking and extend their learning through their interactions. Teachers value parents’ contribution to their child’s learning and work in partnership with parents and whānau to promote positive outcomes for each child. Parents enhance the programme by sharing their skills and expertise with children and teachers. A recent initiative in assessment and planning is providing opportunities for teachers, parents and whānau to share and document children’s learning and progress, which strongly supports children’s holistic development.</p><p>The head teacher continues to provide strong professional leadership with the guidance and support of the ESM. The long-standing, experienced teaching team are strong advocates for children and their whānau.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Teachers are currently involved in research about literacy teaching and learning. ERO and teachers agree this research over time will further develop and strengthen self-review practices and positive learning outcomes for children.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Insoll Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Insoll Kindergarten will be in four years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>13 August 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
