</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Airport Lollipops Educare is a well established early childhood centre, providing care and education for children from birth to school age. The centre is located in purpose-built premises within the vicinity of Auckland Airport. It is part of the Lollipops franchise, independently owned and operated by a Trust. The centre is licensed for 110 children, including a maximum of 40 children up to 2 years.</p><p>The 2012 ERO report identified some good practices that contributed to positive outcomes for children. Management and operations of the centre were well organised. Robust systems that were then in place continue to guide decision-making. Strong relationships with families have been maintained and children continue to enjoy positive, affectionate relationships with adults at the centre.</p><p>Children are cared for in four age-related groups. The outdoor environment is divided into three main play areas: one area for infants and toddlers, another for toddlers and younger children and the other for preschoolers.</p><p>The leadership team is made up of the centre owner, who oversees the operational and administrative aspects of the service, the centre manager and the curriculum manager. The four rooms are led by class coordinators who are responsible for the smooth running of daily programmes.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are confident and are capable communicators. They have developed skills to build and sustain friendships. Children know routines well and trust that adults are there to support their needs. They have a strong sense of wellbeing and belonging.</p><p>The learning environment is accessible for children with good indoor and outdoor flow. The curriculum areas are well defined and children involve themselves in the activities that they choose. The programme is flexible and allows for children to engage in sustained periods of play. Children with Pacific heritages can see their cultures displayed in different areas of the learning environment. It is timely now for teachers to consider how they could strengthen the programme to further support children in their identity, culture and language.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are provided with ample play space which provides them with good opportunities to enjoy uninterrupted safe play. They respond well to the easy pace of the programme. Infants and toddlers are familiar with staff and older toddlers show developing capacity to initiate conversations with adults. Some teachers are in tune with children’s non-verbal communication.</p><p>Staff are positive, sensitive and responsive to children and their families. They are committed to providing an inclusive programme for all children. The ethnic diversity of the teaching team reflects the community they serve. Some teachers use te reo Māori and children’s home languages when communicating with children as they play.</p><p>Children’s language development is supported well by adults. Staff could now increase the use of questioning to extend the complexity and creativity to children’s thinking.</p><p>Programme planning identifies and responds to the learning attributes of individual children. Teachers work with parents to gather and include their ideas and aspirations for children’s learning in their child’s portfolio.</p><p>Children have meaningful opportunities for literacy and mathematics learning throughout the programme. The infant and toddler teaching team continue to embed the learning they have gained through their professional development in 2014.</p><p>Parents interviewed by ERO indicated they felt welcomed and supported. They appreciate the efforts that staff take to settle their children and are satisfied with the programme. Parents affirm the strong relationships they share with the staff.</p><p>Since the 2011 ERO review, appointments of key personnel in the centre have supported the centre manager and increased leadership capacity. The leadership team is improvement focused. Teaching teams are becoming more involved in self review so that it contributes to positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders agree that for teachers to further improve outcomes for children, they could consider:</p><ul>
<li>continuing to strengthen programme planning processes more by identifying and responding to the interests of individual children</li>
<li>continuing to strengthen self review by making the team’s research more evident and using quality indicators and reflective questions to evaluate programmes, teaching practices, and outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>In addition, leaders could review:</p><ul>
<li>staffing in the infant and toddler rooms to further develop the professional knowledge about quality care and effective teaching practice for this age group</li>
<li>the environment, with a view to better supporting children to develop understandings of the dual cultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Airport Lollipops Educare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>The centre is aware of the need for all staff to be Police vetted and for vets to be current.</p><p>To improve current practice the early childhood service management should:</p><ul>
<li>review health and safety policies and procedures to ensure they meet requirements and guide practice</li>
<li>align the centre’s teacher appraisal process more clearly with Registered Teacher Criteria <em>[</em><em>The Education Act 1989, (319D to 319FA), Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood and Care Centre and Early Childhood Curriculum Framework 2008 (HS1-33,) Education Act 1989 (part 10), Education (Registration of Early Childhood Services Teachers) Regulations 2004.]</em></li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Airport Lollipops Educare will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>11 February 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
