</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Clinton Playcentre is open for two mornings a week. Children from birth-to-school age attend. Most children attend with their parents. The sessions are led by parents.</p><p>The playcentre is a parent cooperative. Parents help in all aspects of the programme and centre operation. Recently they have redeveloped the playground. As with all playcentres they benefit from playcentre training.</p><p>The centre is very welcoming for children and their families. Some families travel considerable distances to attend. For them and others the playcentre is an important place for friendships and support. This is especially evident for new parents and new families in the community.</p><p>Over time, the playcentre has had a positive reporting history with ERO. Parents could show ERO that they had made changes in response to the 2011 ERO recommendations.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of reviews of 11 Otago Playcentre Association playcentres.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children settle quickly on arrival and enjoy the play-based programme. Parents are very responsive to the children’s interests and actively involved in their play. They seek out resources and experiences that build on children’s ideas. Special thought is given to how older children can be extended and in providing everyday experiences. For example, children enjoyed fixing furniture and dismantling old kitchen appliances.</p><p>Parents have sustained conversations with children and support their developing social skills. Adults find many opportunities to weave literacy into children’s play and foster a love of books.</p><p>Parents know the children and their home lives well. They use this knowledge to extend children’s conversations and make links between home and centre learning. Children and parents make regular trips into the community, including the local school. Children are well supported in their transition to school.</p><p>Adults find incidental opportunities to introduce children to mathematical concepts. This could be strengthened by more explicitly planning how they will add complexity to children’s mathematical learning over time.</p><p>Through daily discussions and regular meetings, parents reflect on and consider children’s learning and ideas for future learning. The children’s contribution to this process is evident. Parents’ aspirations for their children’s learning are shared and acted on. However, the frequency and quality of records about individual children’s learning varied. These need a greater emphasis on learning, rather than activities and interests, and should show children’s progress over time.</p><p>Some te reo Māori is spoken and several parents have studied to improve their knowledge. Parents want to strengthen the use of te reo Māori.</p><p>With the recent increase in the number of infants and toddlers at the centre, parents are reviewing the physical space, resources and programme for this age group. ERO agrees with this direction.</p><p>Families show a strong commitment to the playcentre and its philosophy. They have clear roles and responsibilities and regularly report against these.</p><p>Parents are improvement focused. They often discuss and reflect on how they support children’s learning and make changes as a result of this.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Further work is needed to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>the use of self review as a way to identify, show and monitor improvements over time</li>
<li>te reo and te ao Māori, including how the culture and identity of its Māori children are celebrated</li>
<li>aspects of assessment, planning and evaluation.</li>
</ul><h3>Governance</h3><p>The Otago Playcentre Association is facing challenges and uncertainty as the Playcentre Federation and the training it provides undergoes a period of restructuring. During this time, the association has made it a priority to focus on the daily operations of the playcentres. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>managing an association-wide system for all aspects of health, safety and compliance</li>
<li>on-going provision of playcentre training.</li>
</ul><p>ERO found that the association needs to:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen the appraisal process for all employed personnel</li>
<li>ensure that association policies provided to the playcentres are regularly reviewed</li>
<li>be more responsive and timely to training needs to enable playcentres to meet licensing and employment requirements.</li>
</ul><p>Each playcentre has the ongoing support of a centre advisor. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>regular visits to provide informal and formal feedback and encouragement</li>
<li>helping parents know what to do to meet the licensing requirements.</li>
</ul><p>Centre advisors should find ways to make best practice common practice across the association, for example through effective self review and planning.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Clinton Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Supervision of children was not always as vigilant as it needed to be. Parents need to ensure children are adequately and consistently supervised at all times.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p><p>The next ERO review of Clinton Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>14 October 2014</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
