<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Tree Bears Nursery and Preschool is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children. The ability of the centre to build on and sustain this will be influenced by how well recently developed initiatives are embedded into the centre&rsquo;s operation and programme planning and assessment practices.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Tree Bears Nursery and Preschool, is a family owned business based in a rural, alpine community.</p><p>Since the 2009 review, the service has been relicensed under the 2008 regulations. As a result of relicensing, the service has been involved in external professional development to strengthen operational and curriculum management systems. These systems are at the early stages of implementation across the teaching team.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The owner and other teachers are welcoming and inclusive of all children and their parents. They foster warm, respectful, reciprocal relationships across the centre.</p><p>Children are actively involved in the spacious, attractive, purposefully presented learning environment. High quality resources and learning activities inspire children&rsquo;s curiosity and exploration.</p><p>The management team and teachers demonstrate a strong commitment to working as a team and focusing on positive outcomes for children. They have established a culture in which children are valued and affirmed for who they are and what they bring to their learning. Teachers' interactions and routines are unhurried and respectful of children&rsquo;s needs.</p><p>Teachers' consistent guidance supports children&rsquo;s social interactions and learning. ERO observed children playing cooperatively, sharing ideas with each other and involved in imaginative play for long periods of time. Children demonstrated a sense of belonging and confidence in the learning environment. Teachers encouraged children to take responsibility for themselves and the environment.</p><p>Teachers promote children&rsquo;s oral language and social conversation skills as they involve themselves in children&rsquo;s play. Mat times are well managed, with children engaging in interesting and appropriate learning activities, including music and movement sessions.</p><p>Transition from the nursery to the preschool is well supported and responsive to the needs of individual children and families.</p><p>The centre managers have good professional relationships with the local school. Children are well supported to make a positive transition to school through a well focused centre programme.</p><p>Recent external professional development has had a positive impact on the development of centre operational and curriculum management systems. There are clear links between the centre vision, values and the strategic plan. The strategic plan is linked to the annual plan which includes curriculum self review.</p><p>The centre management team show a strong commitment to the philosophy, vision and goals of the service. Leaders value the new self-review processes and ensure that teachers have time for critical reflection on their practice to enhance learning outcomes for children. There is a stronger focus on professional leadership and direction to the teaching team. The management team model care and respect for one another, for staff and for children.</p><p>The centre management team is at the early stages of implementing new centre operational and curriculum management systems. The next step is for the managers to refine and consolidate the implementation of these systems so that they can be assured that these have a positive impact on teaching and learning outcomes for children. This includes programme planning, assessment, self review and appraisal.</p><p>As mentioned in the 2009 ERO report, the management team should also strengthen bicultural perspectives in centre practices and documentation including the philosophy statement.</p><p>ERO recommends that the centre continues with external professional development to refine and embed recent developments.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Tree Bears Nursery and Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>16 October 2012</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li><em>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</em></li>
<li><em>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</em></li>
<li><em>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</em></li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</em></li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
