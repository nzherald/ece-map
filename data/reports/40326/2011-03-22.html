<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>Footsteps Education Ltd is a privately owned and operated national home-based care service, with its head office in Tauranga. The service was previously known as Linmark and has been under new ownership and management since 2008. It caters for children up to the age of five years and includes children under the guardianship of Child, Youth and Families Services (CYFS). At the time of this review the Waikato chartered network 40326, employed 24 caregivers. There are 34 children under their care, and 16 are of M&#257;ori descent. This is the first review for this charter.</p><p>The national organisation has established a planned centralised approach to the service&rsquo;s development and operations. Further development of the service&rsquo;s vision should enhance the service&rsquo;s strategic direction and plan. Footsteps management has recently developed an action plan to monitor health and safety matters in caregiver homes.</p><p>The Waikato chartered network is overseen by a professional services director who supports all professional staff. The regional leader, together with kaiako (registered early childhood teachers) has recently implemented goals to improve all aspects of the quality of education and care for young children in home-based care.</p><p>Kaiako visit a wide range of caregiver homes and model early childhood educational practices that engage young children. Interactions with babies and toddlers are nurturing, affirming and respectful. In some homes caregivers used te reo M&#257;ori in children&rsquo;s learning journals, and kaiako use affirming comments in their notes to assist caregivers.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO will review the service again within three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Footsteps Education Ltd was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by Footsteps Education Ltd to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the service (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atFootsteps Education Ltd.</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>Footsteps Education Ltd. 40326 is a chartered service established in 2008 in the Waikato region. The service provides home-based education for children, including children under the guardianship of Child, Youth and Family Services (CYFS). The recently appointed regional leader is a provisionally registered early childhood teacher, has overall responsibility for the operation of the network and reports to the umbrella organisation. Two provisionally registered early childhood teachers (kaiako) provide support and guidance for caregivers in the education and care of young children. This is the first education review for this charter. Four caregiver homes were visited during this review.</p><h3>Areas of good performance</h3><p>Governance and management: The directors and management team have developed effective management systems to support service operations and professional practice. They provide clear expectations and guidelines for regional leaders, kaiako and caregivers through comprehensive documentation and open communication. A robust appraisal process provides staff with effective professional guidance. A particular strength of management is the effective use made of external specialists to guide and inform the development and improvement of the service.</p><p>Interactions: Positive, caring and responsive interactions are evident between children, caregivers and kaiako. Children are settled in their home environments, play confidently alongside caregivers, and receive affection and nurture from them.</p><p>Kaiako effectively model good practice and skilfully include useful information in their conversations to support and develop caregivers&rsquo; understanding of their roles and responsibilities. They effectively encourage interactions for learning and build on the emerging strengths and interests of children.</p><p>Programme implementation: Dedicated caregivers use a range of learning experiences that are responsive to children&rsquo;s cultural heritage. They provide interesting and meaningful opportunities that build on children&rsquo;s identified interests and support children&rsquo;s developing literacy and mathematics concepts. Some children attend early childhood centres.</p><p>Kaiako and caregivers provide for learning and record aspects of children&rsquo;s emerging interests in learning journey books. These books provide a record of children&rsquo;s participation in activities during their time in care. Kaiako visit notes provide high quality evidence of children&rsquo;s progress and development.</p><p>Learning environments: Children receive good quality care and enjoy a variety of age-appropriate resources in both indoor and outdoor settings that encourage them to make choices, explore and persist in their play. There are examples of outdoor settings that provide children with physical challenge and links to the natural world. In some homes, caregivers provide a range of literacy resources that includes books written in te reo M&#257;ori. Caregivers&rsquo; homes provide children with environments that contribute to their wellbeing and development.</p><h3>Agreed area for development and review</h3><p>Strategic planning and self review: There is a need to strengthen the documentation link between review practices and strategic planning. Particular attention should be given to:</p><ul>
<li>documenting the linking of strategic goals to the appraisal process and professional development;</li>
<li>improving the durability of children&rsquo;s learning journals/portfolio files to make them more accessible and visible;</li>
<li>reviewing the use and purpose of resources; and</li>
<li>improving quality assurance, in particular the standard of health and safety in caregivers&rsquo; homes.</li>
</ul><p>Attention to these aspects should enable the service to effectively monitor progress.</p><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 National Evaluation Topic</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h3>Partnerships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children in early childhood services</h3><p>As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p><ul>
<li>this service understands and values the identity, language and culture of M&#257;ori children and their wh&#257;nau, particularly when the child and wh&#257;nau transition to the service;</li>
<li>managers and educators have built relationships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children; and</li>
<li>this service works in partnership with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children.</li>
</ul><h3>Background</h3><p>An outcome of a review in 2009 on staff capability and understanding is the bicultural initiative Ara Poutama. This was developed in consultation with local iwi and is designed to build staff understanding in te reo and tikanga Maori. The service has been implementing identified aspects of this review.</p><h3>Areas of strength</h3><p>Biculturalism: Regional leaders and staff demonstrate a willingness to strengthen bicultural perspectives across the service. Aspects of M&#257;ori culture are visible and valued at many levels of operations. M&#257;ori children are cared for in homes that reflect and value whanaugatanga. In some homes, caregivers used te reo M&#257;ori in children&rsquo;s learning journals and kaiako contribute notes to assist caregivers.</p><p>Relationships and interactions are welcoming and positive for M&#257;ori children and their wh&#257;nau. Kanohi ki te kanohi conversations are highly valued and form an important part of the way information is shared between kaiako and caregivers. Learning stories by kaiako are well written and in some cases te reo M&#257;ori phrases are used in their reports about children.</p><h3>Area for development and review</h3><p>Implementing Ara Poutama: The regional leaders and kaiako have identified the need for ongoing professional development and support for staff in the use of te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori and its implementation in planning, assessment and evaluation.</p><a id="4-assurance-on-compliance-areas" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4 Assurance on Compliance Areas</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>Before the review, the management and staff of Footsteps Education Ltd completed an ERO Home-Based CareManagement Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they have attested that they had taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>

</table><p>22 March 2011</p><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-footsteps-education-ltd" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Footsteps Education Ltd</h2><p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Footsteps Education Ltd (40326).</p><p>Footsteps Education Ltd is a privately owned and operated national home-based care service, with its head office in Tauranga. The service was previously known as Linmark and has been under new ownership and management since 2008. It caters for children up to the age of five years and includes children under the guardianship of Child, Youth and Families Services (CYFS). At the time of this review the Waikato chartered network 40326, employed 24 caregivers. There are 34 children under their care, and 16 are of M&#257;ori descent. This is the first review for this charter.</p><p>The national organisation has established a planned centralised approach to the service&rsquo;s development and operations. Further development of the service&rsquo;s vision should enhance the service&rsquo;s strategic direction and plan. Footsteps management has recently developed an action plan to monitor health and safety matters in caregiver homes.</p><p>The Waikato chartered network is overseen by a professional services director who supports all professional staff. The regional leader, together with kaiako (registered early childhood teachers) has recently implemented goals to improve all aspects of the quality of education and care for young children in home-based care.</p><p>Kaiako visit a wide range of caregiver homes and model early childhood educational practices that engage young children. Interactions with babies and toddlers are nurturing, affirming and respectful. In some homes caregivers used te reo M&#257;ori in children&rsquo;s learning journals, and kaiako use affirming comments in their notes to assist caregivers.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO will review the service again within three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood service we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the service or see the ERO website, www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Richard Thornton</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood services; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each service&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><p>Quality of Education &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</p><p>Additional Review Priorities &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a service, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</p><p>National Evaluation Topics &ndash; This strand contribute to the development of education policies and their effective implementation. The information from this strand is aggregated by ERO for its national evaluation reports. Topics for investigation are changed regularly to provide up-to-date information.</p><p>Compliance with Legal Requirements &ndash; assurance that this service has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this service.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a service is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this service.</p></html>
