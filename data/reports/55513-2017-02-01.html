</table><p>In 2014 ERO identified that the service had made progress in relation to issues identified in the February 2013 ERO report. However, gains have not been sustained. Key aspects of practice and operation continue to require development. Professional support specifically targeted to areas of concern is necessary.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>The Redwood Kindergarten and Daycare is a private early learning service located in a semi-rural setting on the outskirts of Havelock North. It is licensed for 55 children including 15 aged up to two years. Of the 67 children enrolled, 20 identify as Māori. Families represent a variety of cultures.</p><p>Since the 2014 supplementary ERO review, the centre has been purchased by the previous centre manager who continues to manage the business and take responsibility for teaching and the education programme. Two head teachers lead the teaching teams, one working predominantly with children aged up to two years and the other with children aged over two. There has been a 50% turnover in staff since that time.</p><p>The previous review found significant progress had been made in addressing concerns identified in the February 2013 ERO report. However, much development work was still needed in relation to the education programme.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The development of a philosophy to guide teaching and learning has yet to be completed. This remains a priority.</p><p>The strong focus on developing relationships with families, and in the community, contributes to the friendly tone of this service. Some families are beginning to give their time and expertise to provide practical support for the centre. </p><p>Professional learning and development (PLD) has supported better provision for infants and toddlers. Teachers are consistently responsive, kind and caring in their approach. Further consideration should be given to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>ensuring there is time and sufficient opportunities for teachers to engage deeply with all children, especially at routine times</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increasing the focus on supporting children in their self-chosen learning and acknowledging their competence as learners</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improving resourcing to enhance opportunities for children to investigate possibilities through play</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>lessening the focus on completing domestic tasks.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>More flexible routines have enhanced the programme for older children. To strengthen learning opportunities teachers should ensure:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>children have ready access to an appropriate range of resources and the full learning programme for the duration of the licensed opening hours</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>resources are consistently organised to attract children's interest and invite their investigation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>opportunities for children to be creative and expressive are maximised</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>children have opportunities to deeply engage in and revisit their self-chosen play over time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>children's movements are not overly restricted by adults' domestic tasks and routines</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>teachers have sufficient time and opportunities for sustained engagement with individuals in their learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a bicultural perspective is effectively woven into the programme.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Improved attention is being given to the transition of children into the daycare and through to the kindergarten. Teachers' approach is responsive to children's needs and families' views.</p><p>Relationships with local schools are being developed through the centre's participation in a cluster focused on the transition process. Reciprocal visiting is occurring. The centre's next step should be to make its approach more purposeful to support the sharing of information about individual children's learning.</p><p>An on-line programme is improving teachers' communication with families about their children's participation in the programme and aspects of their learning.</p><p>The progress previously made in developing the team's approach to planning for learning has not been sustained. While a group, theme-based programme is in place, there should be a stronger focus on authentically identifying individual children's interests, talents and dispositions to learn, and putting plans in place to strengthen these. Narrative learning records do not effectively show how teachers are noticing, recognising and responding to children's learning to support their progress over time. Children do not have ownership of, or free access to, their learning records to enable them to reflect on their learning. The development of a suitable approach to assessment, and guidelines to support teachers' practice, are priorities. </p><p>The manager and head teachers work collaboratively to lead the teaching teams. A shared approach to leadership is developing that should contribute to the sustainability of operation. Teachers' development is supported by a range of PLD.</p><p>The appraisal process has been strengthened over time to provide better support for teachers to reflect on their practice in relation to professional teaching requirements. Improvement to the goal setting process, the quality of teachers' development goals, and the addition of targeted observations of practice with focused, constructive feedback should add further rigour to the centre's approach.</p><p>A suitable mentoring and induction programme must be put in place to support provisionally certificated teachers to meet all requirements for registration.</p><p>While some reviews of practice have been undertaken, leaders have yet to develop an internal evaluation process to support decision making about improvement and sustainability of operation.</p><p>An annual plan provides guidance around the timely meeting of accountabilities and organisation of operation. A long-term plan that details priorities linked to the development of teaching and learning should be a next step.</p><p>The manager and leaders should seek ways to strengthen their understanding of best practice linked to teaching and learning to support planning for improvement and sustainability of operation.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of The Redwood Kindergarten and Daycare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children’s health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements </p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO found significant areas of non-compliance in the service related to: premises and facilities; curriculum; and health and safety. The service provider must ensure:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>children's access to the licensed space is not unnecessarily limited</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a sufficient quantity and variety of furniture, equipment and materials is provided that is appropriate for the learning and abilities of the children attending</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>individual bedding is provided for sleeping or resting children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the service curriculum is informed by assessment, planning and evaluation ( documented and undocumented) that demonstrates an understanding of children's, learning, their interests , whānau and life contexts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>heavy furniture, fixtures and equipment that could fall or topple and cause serious injury or damage are secured.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><em>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, PF2, PF4, PF31, C2, HS6</em></p><p>Since the on-site stage of the ERO review the owner has responded quickly to address health and safety concerns. Children have been provided with individual bedding and improved systems for management of risks in the environment have been implemented.</p><h3>Recommendation to Ministry of Education</h3><p>ERO recommends that the Ministry reassess the licence of The Redwood Kindergarten and Daycare. ERO will not undertake a further education review of this service until the Ministry of Education is satisfied that the service meets licensing requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of The Redwood Kindergarten and Daycare will be in consultation with the Ministry of Education.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>1 February 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
