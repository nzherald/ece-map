</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Early Impressions Childcare is a well established community-based, non-profit early childhood education centre located in Johnsonville. It operates on Mondays to Fridays from 8.30am to 1.30pm.</p><p>The centre is licensed for 25 children, including up to five children up to two years of age. Children attend the centre one or two days each week. Of the current roll of 83 children, seven are Māori and 12 are Asian. Good staffing ratios support children’s learning and development. Staff are qualified and registered teachers.</p><p>The Johnsonville Community Centre Management Committee is responsible for governance of the service and is supported by a centre manager.</p><p>Leaders and teachers have worked collaboratively to address the next steps identified by the March 2012 ERO report.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre philosophy is focused on empowering children to learn and is evident in practice. Children are settled and take responsibility for their own learning. They learn and play in a well organised spacious indoor area and an outdoor area that promotes physical activity and exploration. Children are confident, curious and self motivated learners.</p><p>Interactions between teachers and children are warm, nurturing and respectful. Children are confident, happy, and display a sense of belonging. They participate in independent and collaborative play. Aspects of literacy, mathematics and science concepts are presented in meaningful contexts. Teachers using questioning more explicitly and modelling appropriate language should further extend children’s learning.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are nurtured and encouraged to explore their surroundings. Their needs are acknowledged and catered for in the mixed-age programme. Primary care givers support children to settle into the centre.</p><p>Staff work collaboratively to respond to children’s interests. Teachers reflect daily on programme and learning activities and make appropriate changes. They review programme focuses at the end of each term, noting children’s participation and involvement. Centre leaders acknowledge a next step is to evaluate the effectiveness of programmes on children’s learning.</p><p>The curriculum acknowledges and is responsive to children’s identity and culture. Centre leaders agree that the bicultural programme, and building on and giving significance to Māori learners’ culture, language and identity, are areas to continue to strengthen. Teachers should continue to make use of <em>Ka</em> <em>Hikitia: Accelerating Success 2013 - 2017</em> and <em>Tātaiako: Cultural Competencies for Teachers of Māori Learners</em> to strengthen responsiveness to Māori.</p><p>Children’s learning is documented in recently implemented electronic portfolios. They provide parents with a record of children’s participation during their time at the centre. Centre leaders have identified, and ERO's evaluation finds, that this is still an area for further development.</p><p>Parents are encouraged to be involved in their children’s learning. Teachers and leaders use a range of approaches to consult and communicate with parents and families. Regular and useful information is made available to parents about centre activities and programmes.</p><p>A flexible approach to supporting transition into the centre meets individual children and their families’ needs. Centre leaders continue to investigate how to strengthen processes to transition children to kindergarten and school.</p><p>Self review has been an area of ongoing development. Clear processes have been developed that effectively guide review to make changes to the environment and improve learning opportunities for children. Staff develop a set of indicators for each review undertaken. The process should be strengthened by teachers evaluating the impact of improvements on the outcomes for children.</p><p>Appraisal processes are useful and appreciated by staff to support their ongoing growth as professionals. Appraisal includes elements of self and peer reflection and links to the registered teacher criteria. Teachers recognise the need for more ongoing, formal professional dialogue about their practice. Centre leaders have identified that revisiting and reflecting on development goals more often during the year should further improve and strengthen teacher practice.</p><p>Management provides clear expectations for centre operation through strategic planning that links to an annual plan. The teaching and management teams work well together. The centre manager and head teacher work closely to promote positive outcomes for children. They provide effective leadership for teachers.</p><p>Teachers are reflective. They are focused on improving the quality of teaching and learning for children.</p><h3>Key next steps</h3><p>Managers and teachers should strengthen the evaluation of programme effectiveness for children's learning.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Early Impressions Childcare completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Early Impressions Childcare will be in three years.<img src="assets/index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" alt="" title=""></p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>17 April 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
