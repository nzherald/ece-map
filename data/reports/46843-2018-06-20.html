</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Creators on Grandview is a full-day education and care service located in Hamilton. It is one of three centres in the Waikato that are part of the Creators Educational Trust. It is licensed for 60 children from birth to school age, including up to 15 under two years of age, in three aged-based rooms. Children over the age of two share a large outdoor playground. Children under two years have a designated outdoor play space. The current roll is 38, and 26 children identify as Māori.</p><p>Creators Educational Trust is a registered charitable trust. The board has an independent chairperson and has recently appointed a new trustee. A new chief executive officer was internally appointed at the beginning of 2018. The board and executive team support work in collaboration and are responsible for the overall strategic direction and daily operations of the centre.</p><p>The centre's philosophy aims to provide a loving, respectful, exciting, and inviting learning environment that fosters all children to develop holistically. Christian values underpin the notion that children deserve our best, and partnerships with parents are valued.</p><p>This is the centre's first ERO review.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children of all ages benefit from respectful, inclusive teaching practices. Teachers have a shared vision and approach to children’s learning. They are responsive and use rituals as a way to value and honour children. Children’s questions are valued and teachers listen carefully for meaning, offering opportunities for exploration and problem solving. Responsive and respectful interactions between teachers and children support the building of independent and confident children.</p><p>The curriculum effectively responds to the emerging interests of children, which promotes educational success. The environment is reflective of a natural and home-like learning space. Equipment and resources promote opportunities for inquiry, problem solving and challenge. Children direct their own learning and they are encouraged to make choices and decisions about their play. Children are confident, competent and fully engaged in their learning.</p><p>Parents and families are well informed about their child’s learning. Well-presented digital and hard-copy portfolios are available. Assessment captures children’s engagement in the life of the centre and their learning. Early literacy and mathematical learning is woven through the programme, supporting children's growing oral language and understanding of mathematical concepts. Children are being supported to build their knowledge about New Zealand’s unique bi-cultural heritage through the use of te reo and tikanga Māori, waiata and karakia. Children experience a curriculum where they are heard and encouraged to become successful learners and explorers.</p><p>Children with special needs are well supported. They are encouraged to engage in all areas of the programme. Leaders work collaboratively with outside agencies. Relationships are valued and there is a strong focus on equity to support vulnerable children and their families. Transitions into, through and beyond the centre are flexible and responsive to each child and their family.</p><p>Children under two years benefit from nurturing teaching interactions in a safe and calm environment. Teachers recognise and respond appropriately to children’s needs. Well-established communication processes between teachers and parents support children’s sense of security and wellbeing. The separate space for babies and toddlers allows them to freely explore, promoting curiosity and independence.</p><p>Leaders have a strong commitment to establishing and maintaining positive, reciprocal relationships. The centre’s core values, strong sense of purpose and direction are supported through professional relationships formed between leaders and staff. Clear roles, responsibilities and expectations have been developed to guide teacher practice. Professional learning and development helps build teacher capability. Leaders and teachers promote a culture where children are valued and affirmed as competent learners.</p><p>The executive team have well-developed systems and processes that guide daily operations. The values and philosophy have been established and are fully enacted. A new five year business strategic direction has been developed. Self review at all levels is well established and strongly leads to change in practice and centre improvement. The executive team work collaboratively and support the centre manager in her role.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The leaders and ERO agree that priority should be given to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>developing a centre specific plan, in consultation with all stakeholders, with clear goals linked to positive learning outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing a localised curriculum to reflect the revised <em>Te Whariki</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening appraisal to align with the Education Council requirements.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Creators on Grandview completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Creators on Grandview will be in three years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Waikato</p><p><span>Te Tai Miringa - Waikato / Bay of Plenty Region</span></p><p>20 June 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
