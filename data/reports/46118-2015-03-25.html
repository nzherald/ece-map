</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Edukids Baverstock is owned and managed by the Kidicorp group. The centre is situated on the grounds of Baverstock Oaks Primary School in Botany, Auckland. It provides care and education for children from babies to school age. The centre is licensed for up to 100 children, including 25 children under the age of two years. The centre is based in a new purpose-built complex and has been in operation for two years. This is the centre’s first ERO review.</p><p>The centre is managed by an experienced leader who is improvement focused. She is supported by Kidicorp professional managers who work collaboratively with the centre to promote positive outcomes for children. The majority of teachers are qualified and registered.</p><p>There are four rooms in the centre and each caters for a different age range of children. Transition through the centre is monitored closely by teachers, and is based around children’s readiness.</p><p>The centre’s philosophy is evident in the programme and strongly emphasises partnerships with parents/whānau and the wider community. The programme is reflective of the dual cultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand.</p><p><em>Te Whariki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, guides the teaching and learning programme. This programme is based on children’s individual and group interests.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children participate well in the programme and are busy making choices about their play. They are involved in activities provided and have good access to resources to support their play. Children are confident and can express their ideas clearly to adults and their peers. They enjoy uninterrupted play for prolonged periods of time. Children play well on their own and with each other in small groups. They engage in interesting and imaginative conversations with each other and adults.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are supported in their learning and development through programmes that are planned to suit their individual needs. Teachers use a primary caregiver approach to support children who are new to the centre. It could now be helpful to discuss and review teaching practices for infants and toddlers to ensure teachers have shared understandings of practices that are most effective in supporting their work with these younger children.</p><p>Teachers follow children’s interest in the daily programme and provide resources to support children’s play. They develop and plan programmes based on information they know about children and make regular informal observations of them. Children's emerging interests are recorded in portfolios. This information contributes to parents’ understanding of their child’s learning and development.</p><p>Teachers acknowledge the diverse cultures of children. This diversity is reflected in the programme and is evident in wall displays and the environment. Some teachers are able to speak children’s first language, supporting children to settle quickly in to the centre and helping families to gain good understandings of what happens in the centre. Parents’ contribution to the programme is highly valued and encouraged.</p><p>Teachers are continuing to build on their bicultural practices. There is a deliberate promotion of te reo Māori and tikanga in the daily programme. Children learn about their whakapapa/genealogy, waiata/Māori songs and aspects of their cultural identity.</p><p>The environment is attractive and inviting. Areas of play are well defined and support children’s independent play. Teachers work collaboratively to facilitate smooth transitions for children into the centre as well as to school. Literacy, numeracy and science concepts are evident and deliberately interwoven into the programme and teaching approaches.</p><p>The managers work to maintain a culturally inclusive learning environment that is reflective of the community it serves. Administrative and operational systems guide teaching practices and the strategic vision of the centre. Some spontaneous self review is evident and has lead to centre-wide improvements.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre manager actively reflects on how the centre can better achieve positive outcomes for children and, together with Kidicorp professional support managers, has identified areas that need improvement. ERO agrees that key next steps for the centre should include:</p><ul>
<li>establishing a clearer, more rigorous process for self review that is well understood by staff to better facilitate ongoing centre improvement</li>
<li>using the teacher appraisal processes more effectively to identify best practice, guide teachers’ professional goal setting, and inform decisions about staff professional development priorities</li>
<li>the development and use of key indicators to help centre leaders and teachers build shared understandings of how best to enact the centre’s philosophy in the daily programme and teaching practice</li>
<li>continued work to promote bicultural practices within the centre’s programme.</li>
</ul><p>It would also be useful to further strengthen centre assessment, planning and evaluation practices. Centre managers and teachers should work together to review children’s portfolios so that they become a more useful record of the individual child’s learning journey and teachers’ partnerships with whānau.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Edukids Baverstock completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Edukids Baverstock will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>25 March 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
