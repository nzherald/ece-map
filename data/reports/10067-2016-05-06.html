</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kaukapapa Pre-School is a well established privately owned early childhood centre located in the Kaukapakapa village. It continues to provide high quality full day care and education for local children from birth to school age.</p><p>The well resourced and spacious centre includes a large covered outdoor deck in addition to the main outside area. The centre has access to a nearby native forest area that is often visited as part of the programme.</p><p>Children under the age of two years have their own area within the building and a connecting covered outdoor area. They also often spend time with the older children.</p><p>The owner manages the centre with the support of qualified and experienced teachers who have a significant input into strategic planning, the day-to-day running of the centre and the education programme for children.</p><p>The centre philosophy is consistent with the intentions <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and has been influenced by professional development, a Ministry of Education sponsored programme called The Incredible Years, that promotes children's persistence, academic, emotional, social and behavioural learning.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children experience care and respect from adults and from each other, and have many opportunities to learn and to develop appropriate social skills. For much of the day they are able to manage their own play with the support of teachers. Children often cooperate and collaborate with one another as they investigate, explore and create.</p><p>Teachers know the children and their families well. They use this information to ensure that the educational programme reflects children's interests, strengths and needs. Parents contribute to assessment and planning by sharing information with teachers about their children's lives outside the centre, and respond positively to centre initiatives.</p><p>Teachers encourage children to lead their own play. They set up and resource the environment to promote children's curiosity and to extend their interests. The interactions between children and teachers provide many opportunities for children to develop their oral language skills. Children learn early literacy and numeracy skills and knowledge through meaningful contexts in play. Children are encouraged to be creative and problem solvers.</p><p>The educational programme has a strong bicultural focus with all children having many opportunities to experience and learn about aspects of tikanga and te reo Māori. The older children participate in weekly kapa haka practice, supported by students from the local school.</p><p>The staff work well together with an agreed understanding of their roles as teachers and how to interact purposefully with children. They share a common approach to supporting children who have special behavioural or educational needs.</p><p>Staff performance is well managed. Teachers' strengths are recognised and they are encouraged to take leadership roles. Teachers respond well to these leadership opportunities. The processes of mentoring and appraising teachers celebrate and encourage ongoing improvement. Professional development opportunities are relevant to centre priorities and have a positive impact for children.</p><p>The manager takes a strategic approach to reviewing the centre operations and facilities, and to planning further developments. She is responsive to suggestions made during ERO evaluation processes. There are good processes in place to monitor aspects of health and safety.</p><p>Centre staff have identified the following appropriate areas that they would like to strengthen. These include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>aspects of the outdoor environment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a review of how policies and procedures are organised</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the efficiency of processes for planning and assessing children's learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kaukapakapa Pre-School completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kaukapakapa Pre-School will be in four years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>6 May 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
