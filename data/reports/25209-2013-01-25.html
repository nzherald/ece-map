<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>The Patumahoe/Mauku Playcentre is well placed to continue to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Patumahoe/Mauku Playcentre is situated on the grounds of the local school in the semi-rural town of Patumahoe. Centre members provide programmes for infants and children up to five years of age. Some parents and wh&#257;nau are paid to supervise three afternoon extension sessions for older children. The centre operates as a parent co-operative and is part of the Counties Playcentre Association. Parents have the opportunity to be involved in all decision-making.</p><p>The centre&rsquo;s learning environment is spacious, attractive and very well resourced. Areas of play have been well organised to invite children&rsquo;s exploration.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children enjoy their time at the centre. The inclusive nature of the Playcentre enables all parents/wh&#257;nau and children to feel welcome and valued. Children are engaged in play for extended periods of time and confidently learn alongside other children and adults. They are well supported in their play through ongoing conversations and adults&rsquo; use of good questioning skills.</p><p>The centre is effectively managed by its members, who are proud of the centre and enthusiastic about their provision for their children&rsquo;s education. They have developed a close relationship with the local school and support children&rsquo;s transition to school well.</p><p>Centre members are enthusiastic about their roles and responsibilities and have good processes to ensure the centre is well managed and maintained. They are encouraged to continually increase their knowledge of effective early childhood practice through Playcentre courses. They model good practice for each other. Office holders encourage other members to take on positions of responsibility.</p><p>Parents plan programmes together and recognise the importance of children&rsquo;s play. The implementation of programmes reflects their belief that children are capable, confident learners. Children&rsquo;s activities, interests and milestones are regularly recorded in portfolios by many different centre members, enabling children to revisit their time at the centre and talk about their experiences.</p><p>Centre self-review practices continue to develop. Members are reflective and use a variety of ways to evaluate the programme and how they support children&rsquo;s play and learning. Recent self review has focussed on ways to better engage infants and toddlers and to provide more age-appropriate challenges for these younger children. Plans for an Association support worker to help centre members to recognise children&rsquo;s interests, learning, dispositions and skills better, and to better record children&rsquo;s progress over time , should further improve self review. The supervisor, parents and wh&#257;nau could also consider ways to share their daily reflections of children&rsquo;s learning with adults attending other sessions to help inform planning and provide continuity for children.</p><p>Centre members acknowledge the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa/New Zealand. Some parents and wh&#257;nau have good knowledge of te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori and confidently use te reo when working with children. Members also acknowledge that the centre&rsquo;s bicultural officers could help increase the knowledge and confidence of all members in promoting children&rsquo;s knowledge of M&#257;ori language and culture.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Patumahoe/Mauku Playcentre completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>25 January 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the New Zealand government department that reviews schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>Review focus</h3><p>ERO's education reviews in early childhood services focus on the factors that contribute to positive learning outcomes for children. ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
