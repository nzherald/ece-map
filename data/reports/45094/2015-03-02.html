</tr></tbody></table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>The Tree House is a privately owned centre and is located in Whakatane. It has been operating since 2009 and is licensed for 27 tamariki including eight under the age of two. At the time of this review, 24 of the 27 enrolled were Māori.</p>
<p>Mātauranga Māori, <em>Te Whāriki,</em> the early childhood curriculum, and Montessori are clearly reflected in the programme. The centre’s integrated philosophy is enacted in both indoor and outdoor areas and learning activities. The vision of The Tree House is ‘to provide an environment that is supportive, responsive and challenging to explore the genius within each child’. Tamariki direct their own learning in a structured, prepared and well-resourced environment. Leaders and kaiako acknowledge the place of Māori as tangata whenua and are committed to normalising and revitalising te reo and tikanga Māori practices.</p>
<p>The centre has a positive reporting history with ERO. Since the 2012 ERO report an under two area has been established within the centre and five babies and toddlers were enrolled at the time of this review. The experienced and knowledgeable centre owner and manager provides effective governance and leadership for tamariki, kaiako and whānau. There have been some changes in the teaching team. An experienced, specialist Montessori teacher, and a bilingual kaiako were appointed in 2014 to work with babies. There are three fully qualified ECE teachers and two who are currently in training. Three of the staff team are also trained Montessori teachers.</p>
<h3>The Review Findings</h3>
<p>The Montessori philosophy is strongly enacted in all areas of the learning environment. On arrival, tamariki and whānau are warmly welcomed into the pre-school. Respectful relationships are a feature of the centre and tamariki demonstrate a strong sense of belonging. They are encouraged to follow their interests and lead their learning. They engage in sustained play, show high levels of concentration and develop their problem solving and thinking skills. Each child’s independence is encouraged and they are extended to develop practical life skills that promote self-regulation and personal empowerment. Tamariki have specific daily tasks such as caring for animals, gardening, harvesting, preparing and serving kai, and clean up duties.</p>
<p>Whānau appreciate the nurturing of their children and the many opportunities they have to contribute their aspirations and stories about their tamariki. Productive partnerships are formed and wā whānau, encourages parents and families to come in and share their expertise with tamariki. Some examples of this include: poi, kapa haka, waiata video, cooking rēwena bread, collecting shells and eating pipi and sharing whakapapa. Sharing these experiences builds a strong sense of pride and community for all those associated with the centre. </p>
<p>Tamariki have extensive opportunities to investigate the natural world and kaiako naturally integrate te reo Māori, literacy and mathematics within the Montessori framework. Kaiako observe and record what tamariki are interested in, and support and challenge each child to achieve their potential. </p>
<p>Kaiako demonstrate a strong commitment to implementing practices that affirm Māori ways of being. Te reo Māori, tikanga and cultural identity is well integrated, valued and celebrated in everyday routines and conversations. A strong emphasis is placed on the principles of whanaungatanga, manaakitanga, kaitiakitanga and ako. These are clearly fostered in tamariki by kaiako and whānau. Tamariki have multiple opportunities to experience success, and ‘explore their genius' in a Te Ao Māori context’. </p>
<p>A special feature of the centre is the under two’s area, where kaiako provide a calm, creative and bilingual learning environment. Whānau expressed to ERO their appreciation that babies are able to ‘unfold and flourish in their own time’. Tamariki experience a strong sense of aroha with their kaiako and whānau value the close partnership created. This contributes to each child’s positive sense of well being and belonging. </p>
<p>In the Montessori programme, kaiako are highly skilled in recognising the developmental stages of tamariki and use a variety of strategies to extend learning and maximise their learning potential. Assessment portfolios reflect and respond to success in learning for each child. Kaiako identify and record a wide range of varied and complex learning experiences and learning progressions are documented. The next step is to continue to develop consistency in writing the learning stories, and the tracking of individual progress over time across the teaching team.</p>
<p>The centre benefits from highly capable leadership that is solution focused. Leaders have developed a strategic plan, clearly aligned to the Montessori philosophy and bilingual aspirations of the centre. They have prioritised goals for continuing growth and development. Leaders provide useful professional development and support that utilise the expertise and specialist knowledge of their staff.</p>
<p>Kaiako are supported to take on leadership roles. Their individual strengths are valued and contribute to the high quality programme of education and care. The owner has established highly effective self-review processes and practices involving kaiako, whānau contribution and tamariki voice. These processes are focussed on improving outcomes for tamariki. The appraisal process invites kaiako to reflect on their practice and set goals. The centre is continuing to strengthen the appraisal process to include formal documented observations of kaiako and tamariki interactions, discussions and the monitoring of individual and centre goals.</p>
<h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3>
<p>Before the review, the staff and management of The Tree House completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p>
<h3>Next ERO Review</h3>
<p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p>
<p>The next ERO review of The Tree House will be in four years.</p>

<h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3>
<p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here:</a></p>
<ul><li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p>
<p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p>
<p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p>
<p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p>
<h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3>
<p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p>
<ul><li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
