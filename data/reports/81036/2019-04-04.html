</table><p>Roslyn/Maori Hill Playcentre is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Roslyn/Māori Hill Playcentre is open for five morning sessions for children from birth-to-school age. Most parents attend with their children. In the last few years, the roll has become more multi-cultural. Most children attend for one or two days each week and are under four years. Roslyn/Māori Hill Playcentre is one of 47 in the recently formed South Island Southern Region (SISR) hub.</p><p>Since the November 2014 ERO review, the playcentre has experienced significant change. Most of the parent council are relatively new to their roles. Instead of three paid educators, there is now a paid facilitator who works with parents. This reflects the playcentre philosophy of parents as children’s first educators.</p><p>The parent council oversees the day-to-day running of the centre, with members having specific responsibilities. Some members have completed some playcentre training. A centre support worker from the SISR regularly visits.</p><p>This review was one of four in SISR playcentres. The SISR is one of five regions under the New Zealand Playcentre Federation (NZPF). The playcentre organisation is nearing the end of an extensive restructure and review. All playcentres are now part of a national group known as Playcentre Aotearoa.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The parent council and leaders are committed to growing and developing the centre in partnership with the families who attend. They, and other parents, warmly welcome children and their families and support them to settle, feel valued and engage with the playcentre programme and operation. The facilitator works collaboratively with parents to build their understanding about how to best support children's learning.</p><p>Children's wellbeing and learning are well supported. The appropriately resourced environment meets the interests and needs of children of different age groups. The high ratio of parents to children allows for many one-to-one interactions to support children's play, learning and development. Adults affirm and support other children as well as their own. Babies and toddlers especially benefit from a sensory rich/tactile environment.</p><p>There is an increasing emphasis on learning. Parents, with the facilitator, have identified key learning priorities/outcomes they want for children at this playcentre. The group programme reflects these priorities. Each child also has an individual goal. Leaders have identified that the quality of learning stories is variable and are working to strengthen this. Useful visual prompts help adults use child-led experiences to promote learning.</p><p>Children initiate and lead their play and learning, with adults thoughtfully extending this. The children confidently engage with the wide range of activities, resources and equipment provided. They also benefit from learning-focused excursions into the wider community.</p><p>Useful strategic and annual plans are helping guide development. An effective internal-evaluation process informs parents of next steps to improve various aspects of how well they support children and their families.</p><p>NZPF have developed and are implementing a clear national and regional management structure. Some of the new roles have had a very positive impact at centre level. Parent council members value the increased support they receive.</p><p>Of particular significance are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>the centre administrator role which provides sound monitoring of health, safety and compliance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the centre support worker who visits regularly to share best practice and monitor the quality of learning and teaching</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the role of a facilitator, available at every session, to role model good practice and empower parents to implement effective early childhood education for their children.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and the playcentre's parents and leaders agree that next step is to increase parent enrolment in the new NZPF training. This will help parents to:</p><ul>
<li>grow their knowledge and skills as to how best support their children's learning, including having better understanding of <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum</li>
<li>become more involved in the planning, assessment and evaluation for group and individual children's learning</li>
<li>continue to strengthen the Māori dimension in the daily programme and centre practices.</li>
</ul><p>The next steps for the SISR are to:</p><ul>
<li>refine and embed the new NZPF structure, systems and processes, including monitoring and lines of reporting</li>
<li>continue to develop and strengthen the NZPF and individual playcentre internal-evaluation processes and practices.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Roslyn/Maori Hill Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Southern</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>4 April 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
