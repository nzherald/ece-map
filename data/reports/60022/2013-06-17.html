<a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Point Howard Playcentre is developing its capacity to promote positive outcomes for children. With focused association support, and commitment and participation of new members, this objective is likely to be reached.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>The playcentre is one of 18 administered by the Hutt Playcentre Association (the association). Bicultural partnership is integral to the way the association operates. An executive committee provides guidance and support for centre members. This includes leadership for strategic planning, financial management and policy development, and for decisions related to the education programme, property and equipment. A kaitautoko, a centre support person employed by the association, visits and provides professional advice, feedback and role modelling to strengthen practice and promote improvement. The recently commenced review of the association’s structure, supported by an external consultant, is aimed at improving operation and ensuring the sustainability of playcentres.</p><p>The centre runs four mixed-age sessions per week with a paid supervisor leading the daily programme. The core philosophy emphasises the importance of child-led free play.</p><p>The playcentre was recently relicensed under the <em>Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations</em> <em>2008</em>. It has a positive reporting history with ERO.</p><p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to reviews in eight early childhood education services within the Hutt Playcentre Association.</p><h3>Review Findings</h3><p>The tone is settled. Adults are responsive and warm towards children. Many are building their confidence at working as part of a team providing learning experiences for children. High ratios of adults to children promote opportunities for 1:1 interaction.</p><p>A wide range of resources and equipment is available for children. A key feature of the environment is the extensive outdoor play area which allows for a variety of physically active and creative play. A small indoor space is well managed. The interesting environment supports children’s motivation to explore.</p><p>Members’ inclusive approach provides good support to meet a range of learning needs. Parents bring diverse skills, cultures and interests to the programme and these are valued. The centre caters well for children with special development needs.</p><p>Some recent progress has been made in developing members’ approach to planning for learning. Children have profile books which record their participation in playcentre activities. These are amply illustrated with photographs allowing them to revisit past experiences. Planning has become more formalised. Information about individual children’s interests is regularly noted and shared. A next step for members is to develop an approach which includes becoming familiar with <em>Te Whäriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, to better recognise and respond to children’s learning.</p><p>A strong sense of community welcomes all families to this service. Some keen members are showing interest in taking on office holder positions and helping to build the capability of others. With the valuable support of the kaitautoko some progress in a number of new initiatives is apparent.</p><p>The association has a proactive approach to governance. Self review is valued and strongly promoted by the association. Good frameworks are in place to support practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Recently there has been considerable change in membership. Many families are new to the centre and in the early stages of understanding playcentre philosophy and expectations. There is a need for the association to provide extra support for induction and emergent leadership so parents can be full participants in the programme and the cooperative management of the service. In particular, plans should be put in place to facilitate members’:</p><ul>
<li>understanding of the principles underpinning <em>Te Tiriti o Waitangi</em>. A Māori perspective is not yet well developed in the programme</li>
<li>development of a differentiated approach to supporting infants' and toddlers' participation in the learning programme</li>
<li>use of strategies for supporting child-initiated play and emergent learning</li>
<li>shared understanding of the self review process to support improved decision making and strategic planning</li>
<li>understanding of, and participation in, assessment, planning and evaluation of the daily programme</li>
<li>understanding of legislative requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends the association works with centre members to develop an action plan that supports implementation of the key next steps identified in this review. This action plan is to be forwarded to ERO within six months of this confirmed report.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Point Howard Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>During the review ERO identified areas of non-compliance.</p><p>Concern around the heating of the building, identified in the 2009 ERO report has still not been addressed.</p><p>While policies and procedures are in place, these are not always followed. For example, excursion documentation is not always completed and storage of materials is not always appropriate.</p><p>To address these matters the service provider must:</p><ul>
<li>ensure there is a safe and effective means of maintaining room temperature no lower than 16 degrees Celsius<br><em>[Licensing criteria for early childhood education and care centres 2008, PF12.]</em></li>
</ul><ul>
<li>secure furniture or equipment that could fall and cause injury or damage.<br><em>[Licensing criteria for early childhood education and care centres 2008, HS6.]</em></li>
</ul><ul>
<li>ensure that before children leave the premises on an outing or excursion, assessment and management of risk is undertaken as required by the association.<br><em>[</em><em>Licensing criteria for early childhood education and care centres 2008, HS17.]</em></li>
</ul><p>To improve current practice members should ensure that records of operation are kept up-to-date, filed and made accessible.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>Timing of the next review will be determined by the quality of the action plan.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region (Acting)</p><p>17 June 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><p>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
