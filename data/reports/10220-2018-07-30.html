</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Learning Edge Montessori Preschool is a small, established service in the West Auckland suburb of Titirangi. The service provides sessional and full-day care and education for a maximum of 20 children aged between 2 and 6 years.</p><p>The service's experienced, qualified teachers are Montessori-trained and they have a strong Montessori approach. The centre's philosophy is linked to <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and notes that teachers will work collaboratively to support each child's unique development. It promotes building children's independence, confidence and life-skills in meaningful contexts. Parent involvement in events and activities is promoted to enhance outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's 2015 report identified a variety of good practices. It also noted next steps for ongoing improvement. These included promoting children's thinking and complex play, using internal evaluation to guide improvement and strengthening bicultural practices.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The teaching team fosters a deep sense of respect and care. Children reflect these priorities in their relationships and the way they interact. They work well together, with a great deal of conversation, negotiation, support and kindness shown to peers. Older children are thoughtful and caring about their younger peers' wellbeing. Relationships at all levels are positive and caring with a strong sense of belonging and wellbeing.</p><p>Teachers work as facilitators as children explore various activities. They promote children's learning through hands-on exploration. Children have good access to indoor and outdoor areas and engage in focused play. Teachers extend and challenge children's thinking. They give children space and time to work at their own pace. The team is responsive to emerging questions and discoveries. Children's interests are nurtured with additional topics, celebrations and outings.</p><p>The environment is ordered and well cared for. Teachers make good use of routines and modelling to foster appropriate behaviours. Teachers prompt and acknowledge children's developing independence in problem solving and decision making. Children revisit prior learning experiences and materials to reinforce their knowledge and mastery of skills, strongly reflecting a Montessori approach.</p><p>Children's portfolios of learning inform the daily programme. They are regularly shared with families who are invited to give feedback on the programme. Parents meet with teachers to discuss their children's progress in formal and informal ways. This is promoting learning partnerships between teachers and parents. The centre shares good information about the philosophy and teaching to inform the community about the Montessori programme.</p><p>The centre is well led. There is a collaborative approach to goal setting, planning and review. Key priorities are defined in strategic and annual planning. Goals are worked upon in a coordinated way and align with the centre's vision and philosophy. Good systems are in place to promote safety and wellbeing.</p><p>The head teacher has strengthened performance management systems since the 2015 ERO review. There is a strong focus on review and improvement. Targeted professional development has enhanced mentoring. The head teacher fosters professional connections with other services, as well as with schools. Teachers' attendance at annual Montessori conferences strengthens their professional practice networks.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The head teacher's intention to revisit annual planning to define fewer goals, with more specific and deliberate actions, is appropriate. Other key areas that should be prioritised include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>reviewing programmes and bicultural practices in relation to Te Tiriti o Waitangi</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reviewing the philosophy, curriculum, planning and assessment in relation to the principles and strands of <em>Te Whāriki</em> 2017</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>promoting teachers' evaluation of their practice in relation to the service's quality indicators</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>considering ways to promote greater parent and child contribution to assessment portfolios</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>streamlining the documentation of policies and procedures.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Learning Edge Montessori Preschool completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Learning Edge Montessori Preschool will be in three years.</p><p>Julie Foley</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>30 July 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
