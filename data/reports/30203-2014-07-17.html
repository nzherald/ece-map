</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kids to Five Kindy on Jones provides an all-day service for up to 30 children between two years and school age at any one time. The centre is located in a converted house close to Waikato Hospital in the Hamilton suburb of Melville. The centre has enrolled a total of 40 children from a variety of cultural backgrounds, including nine children identified as Māori, six children identified as Pacific and children from a variety of other cultural backgrounds.</p><p>The centre continues to operate under the umbrella of Kidicorp Ltd. The Hamilton regional office of Kidicorp Ltd was established in 2012 and provides strong and effective governance, leadership and management support. This includes well-developed and rigorous self review and quality assurance processes, along with professional, administrative and business support by well-qualified and experienced personnel. These qualities are underpinned by a clear vision and values.</p><p>Since the 2011 ERO review, there have been considerable staff changes, including the appointment of a new centre manager in 2013. The outdoor playground has been redeveloped to provide children with extensive opportunities for active physical play and for exploring the natural world. Kidicorp Ltd and this service work in close partnership with the Ministry of Education to make equitable opportunities available for local families to access early childhood education. The service provides a participation vehicle for transport.</p><p>The centre philosophy promotes a learning environment that encourages children to develop independence, confidence and respectful relationships with others. Family and whānau contributions are valued and their culture is respected.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children at the centre show a strong sense of belonging and wellbeing. They enjoy being part of whole group activities and a wide variety of learning experiences. The environment motivates children to explore widely and engage in a play programme that caters for their emerging interests. Their experiences with sand, water play and the natural environment assists them to experiment and develop an understanding of science and nature. Children develop friendly relationships with other children, and learn to share equipment, play cooperatively, and help one another. Older children act as role models and leaders for younger children, who observe and learn from their actions. The inclusive culture supports all children to develop confidence, a love of learning, and good language skills. Children who come to the centre unable to speak English quickly learn to understand and then begin to communicate in English. Children of all ages have many opportunities to learn early literacy and mathematics in a well-designed and naturally integrated programme.</p><p>Teachers have a strong commitment to supporting children’s growth and development. They know children and their families well and form trusting and respectful relationships. Teachers plan the environment to reflect children’s interests and learning, and work alongside them to extend their understanding. Parents are kept well informed about their children’s development and progress informally, and through yearly interviews.</p><p>Individual portfolios contain a visual and written record of the children’s learning journey, often as members of a group activity. Teachers are beginning to include more examples of individual children’s learning. This needs to continue, so that the information can be used to show children’s progress over time. More attention is now needed to including parents’ contributions in portfolios, so that links are clearly made between home and centre. This will enable teachers to effectively support interests that connect with children’s home life and their cultural identity.</p><p>Parents participate in centre cultural and social events, trips and excursions, and make contributions to the programme. They are invited to share their aspirations for their children, and to identify important aspects of their culture for the centre to include in the programme and environment. The increasingly multicultural nature of the centre has prompted teachers to consider how the many different cultures are recognised in the programme and environment, and to develop ways to celebrate children’s diverse cultural identity and language.</p><p>Te reo and tikanga Māori are included through waiata, karakia and in conversations. Teachers work alongside parents to include celebrations such as Matariki. The centre has identified that its next step will be to continue to develop links with local iwi.</p><p>The enthusiastic centre manager is a highly effective leader of a collaborative team. Staff work together to be welcoming, inclusive, and supportive of parents, whānau and caregivers. They place children’s wellbeing and growth as their first priority. There are opportunities for teachers to take leadership responsibilities. With the assistance of Kidicorp managers, the centre manager has established a sound approach to self review, with a continuing emphasis on improvement.</p><p>The centre is well-supported by Kidicorp Ltd regional and area managers. Their close professional supervision has assisted programme development, relationships with parents, self review and the capability of the teaching team. Kidicorp Ltd personnel continue to provide appropriate leadership for the centre manager and teachers, with a strong focus on improving the quality of education and care.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kids to Five Kindy on Jones completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Kids to Five Kindy on Jones will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>17 July 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
