</table><p>Choice Kids Alfriston Road has made considerable progress since its 2013 ERO review. Centre leaders and staff have improved their use of self review and made improvements to develop a more responsive and relevant curriculum for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Choice Kids Alfriston Road caters for children from birth to school age. The centre is licensed for thirty-seven children, including five up to the age of two years. It offers sessional and full day education and care. The centre caters for a diverse community where many children speak more than one language. Several staff are also bilingual and share the children’s cultures and languages.</p><p>The centre is part of a privately owned and operated network which includes five centres. In consultation with families, owners have begun a significant purpose-built extension to the existing centre. They intend to cater for up to eighty children, including twenty children up to the age of two years.</p><p>To help manage the organisation’s growth, a new management and leadership structure is developing. A general manager role has been created to enable the operation manager to focus on developing the quality of teaching and learning. Administration and additional support staff are in place to improve centre management.</p><p>The service has begun to design an emerging managers’ programme to support leaders to develop their leadership skills. This is likely to be a valuable strategy to build professional capability and maintain the momentum for improvement. New and additional leadership roles in the under and over two areas are planned to further support the centre manager.</p><p>The 2013 ERO report identified a number of significant challenges for the centre to improve the quality of the programme and the outcomes for children. Leaders, teachers and staff have worked diligently to make many positive changes. Centre leaders and staff have made very good use of external professional learning and development support through the Ministry of Education.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Centre managers and staff have maintained a strong commitment to providing for and working with families. Social justice and partnership are a key part of the centre’s approach. Staff enact the centre’s philosophy through whakawhanaungatanga and manaakitanga. Children benefit from this genuine family-friendly approach and an environment that welcomes children and their whānau.</p><p>Children are well supported to develop positive social skills. They demonstrate a strong sense of belonging and connection to the centre. Positive interactions with their teachers and each other helps contribute to a warm and settled atmosphere. Children enjoy learning alongside their friends and teachers.</p><p>Teachers are approachable and friendly. They provide good support for children’s wellbeing. Teachers have improved opportunities for children to offer their contributions and inform the programme. Continuing to review the purpose of routines could offer further opportunities for teachers and children to extend decision making and sustain learning.</p><p>The programme has become more child led and responsive. Several improvements to the planning, assessment and evaluation systems have promoted more relevant and meaningful learning experiences. Children have better access to a wider range of resources. Individual learning portfolios are attractive and useful records of children’s learning and engagement in the programme.</p><p>Children up to the age of two benefit from caring teachers who promote a calm and peaceful environment. Care routines for younger children are appropriately individualised. Positive and responsive interactions are very evident. Teachers could now increase opportunities for younger children to choose to access the outdoors.</p><p>Māori perspectives are well integrated into learning experiences along with highly valued contributions from whānau. Māori children’s mana is enhanced through ongoing professional development that helps teachers engage in respectful ways with children and whānau. Te reo Māori is used well and teachers are increasing their confidence and expertise in this area through well chosen professional development.</p><p>Children of Pacific Island heritage benefit from several teachers who are able to speak their home language. These skilled bilingual teachers also help new children settle quickly and they make positive connections with families. Teachers are also writing useful bilingual learning stories to help promote learning partnerships with families. The individual culture, language and identity of children from Pacific heritage is recognised through regular, meaningful events and celebrations.</p><p>Leadership and management of the centre is now more effective and clearly focused on improvement. Leaders work collaboratively and respectfully with staff. They are focused on increasing positive outcomes for children. Clear policies and procedures support centre operations well. Regular internal audits by organisational leaders offer valuable input to centre leaders about centre operations.</p><p>An appropriate focus for the wider organisation is continuing to enhance the professional knowledge and expertise of staff through useful and relevant external professional development. Strengthening the depth of evaluation using the centre’s philosophy could also support leaders to consolidate the centre’s progress and manage the future expansion.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre leaders agree leaders and staff are well placed to:</p><ul>
<li>develop a shared teaching approach that extends children’s thinking and independence</li>
<li>use current educational research and theory to inform and document the centre’s philosophy and practices for the care and education of younger children</li>
<li>continue to improve the quality of individual children’s assessment to show their progress and success over time</li>
<li>strengthen performance management aligned to the Education Council requirements and increase teachers’ evaluation of the success of their teaching</li>
<li>develop goals that focus on positive learning outcomes for children with measurable indicators to inform selfreview within centre strategic planning.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Choice Kids Alfriston Road completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve practice, centre leaders should ensure adequate shade is provided over the playground and that teachers ensure all children wear hats during outdoor play.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Choice Kids Alfriston Road will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>18 January 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"> ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
