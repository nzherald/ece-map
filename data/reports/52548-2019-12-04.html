</table><p>Tokomaru Early Childhood Centre is not well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Tokomaru Early Childhood Centre is a community-based service catering for children up to school age. It is an all-day licensed service for 22 children aged over two years. Of the 21 children enrolled five identify as Māori.</p><p>The centre is governed by a small committee of parents. Significant change has occurred, activated by the longstanding head teacher/centre manager resigning at the end of Term Three 2019. A newly appointed manager with a primary teaching qualification and full certification oversees centre operation. She supports the fully certificated, early childhood qualified head teacher to guide curriculum delivery. The head teacher and one educator have had a long association with the centre.</p><p>The service's philosophy, reviewed in August 2019, reflects the values and beliefs of teachers, families and whānau.</p><p>The November 2016 ERO report identified strengthening was needed in: assessment, planning and evaluation; appraisal; and culturally responsive practices to promote culture, language and identity. Clarification of governance and management responsibilities was also required.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Following the previous ERO report an action plan was developed to support addressing key next steps resulting in some positive progress. During 2019 some of these improvements have regressed.</p><p>Improvement is needed to support leaders understanding and documenting of health and safety requirements. Development of these records is required to ensure staff understand service expectations and Ministry of Education regulatory requirements. Committee members should investigate undertaking training in order to better define governance roles and responsibilities and support the sustainability of operation.</p><p>Practices to support continuing improvement and evaluate progress require strengthening. Strategic planning provides some useful direction for centre operation and teaching and learning. Further consideration should be given to reviewing the desired objectives in the strategic plan and how these contribute to improving outcomes for children.</p><p>Building staff capability through regular appraisal and programmes of professional development needs consistent implementation for all staff. While some Teaching Council information has been accessed, documents need to be fully updated and systems consistently implemented to ensure that appraisal and certification requirements are met.</p><p>Children enthusiastically engage in an inviting variety of child-initiated, play-based experiences. Teachers select and introduce a range of learning opportunities as part of group programme planning. Observations of children in everyday activities are beginning to build a picture of how teachers notice, recognise and respond to learners' interests and ideas. Teachers should continue to seek support and guidance to build their capability in assessment, planning and evaluation.</p><p>Relationships between children, staff and parent helpers are nurturing and positive. Children communicate with confidence and demonstrate a strong sense of belonging and wellbeing. Many participate in purposeful learning for sustained periods.</p><p>Te reo Māori is at times incorporated into conversations with children. Children confidently contribute to the ritual of mihi whakatau. Māori symbols and natural resources enrich the environment. Teachers should continue to develop culturally responsive practices including extending their knowledge of children's culture, language and identity and local contexts to contribute to programmes.</p><p>Thoughtfully considered approaches support children and their families’ induction into the service. Children’s transitions to school are acknowledged and celebrated. Teachers should consider further ways to share information so that children’s confidence and capability at the centre transfers to the new entrant classrooms.</p><p>Priorities for the service to improve outcomes for children include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continuing to develop assessment, planning and evaluation for children's learning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implementing appraisal for all staff</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>building governance and leadership capability in a deliberate, systematic way</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the monitoring of systems and practices, particularly those for health and safety to track operational expectations and meet regulatory requirements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>internal evaluation, to know the impact of teachers’ practices on children’s learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Tokomaru Early Childhood Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children’s health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO found significant areas of non-compliance in the service related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>completing records of all medicine given to children attending the service</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensuring equipment, premises and facilities are checked every day of operation for hazards to children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implementing a system of regular appraisal for all staff</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implementing appropriate selection and appointment processes, including Safety Checking in accordance with the Children's Act 2014.</p>
</li>
</ul><p><em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, HS28, HS12, GMA7, GMA7A, Children’s Act 2014]</em></p><p>Since the onsite visit, the service has provided ERO with evidence that shows appropriate systems have been developed but are yet to be implemented. These relate to:</p><p>completing records of all medicine given to children attending the service <em>(HS28)</em></p><ul>
<li>
<p>recording and keeping results of safety checks while the person is employed at the service in accordance with the Children’s Act 2014 (<em>GMA7A)</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>checking equipment, premises and facilities every day of operation for hazards to children (<em>HS12)</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensuring appropriate selection and appointment processes, including Safety Checking in accordance with the Children's Act 2014. (<em>GMA7)</em></p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation to Ministry of Education</h3><p>ERO recommends that the Ministry reassess the licence of Tokomaru Early Childhood Centre. ERO will not undertake a further education review of this service until the Ministry of Education is satisfied that the service meets licensing requirements.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services (Central)</p><p>Central Region - Te Tai Pūtahi Nui</p><p>4 December 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup><col> <col> <col> </colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
