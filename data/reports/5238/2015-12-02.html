</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Barsanti Kindergarten is one of 14 administered by the Whanganui Kindergarten Association, (the association). The kindergarten is licensed for 30 children aged over two years and offers six-hour sessions five days per week. Of the 32 children currently enrolled, eight identify as Māori and many have additional learning needs. All three teachers are qualified and registered. One was employed after the October 2012 ERO review.</p><p>The community is culturally and socially diverse. A community worker, employed by the association to support a number of its centres, is based at the kindergarten. Her role is to build relationships between parents and promote links between families and the early childhood service. Developing a sense of community and caring amongst families and children is a priority. A temporary teacher-aide position has been in place to support transition to an increased roll.</p><p>The philosophy emphasises the importance of promoting children’s wellbeing, independence, self esteem, resilience and skills for life.</p><p>A governing board is responsible for setting the overall strategic direction for the association. Dayto-day operation is the role of the general manager, who is accountable to the board. Two senior teachers are employed to support the learning and development of teachers. Two recently appointed cultural advisors support teachers to work with Māori and Pacific children.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of seven kindergarten reviews in the Whanganui Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Curriculum priorities are relevant and highly responsive to children’s needs, emerging interests and strengths. Settling children, promoting their wellbeing and belonging, making connections and ensuring basic needs are met are priorities. An emphasis on care and respect for others is a continuing theme. Literacy, mathematics, physical challenge and science are carefully integrated in meaningful contexts. Children’s oral language development is intentionally promoted through learning conversations, music and singing. Children show high levels of trust in their teachers and engage well in the programme.</p><p>Teachers communicate a real enthusiasm for learning, following children’s leads to support their developing confidence and independence. Their inclusive practice recognises the importance of children’s cultures, identities and languages. Children with additional learning needs are well supported.</p><p>The environment is suitably resourced to support children’s needs and interest in learning. It highlights and celebrates agreed values and priorities, the diversity of the local community, individuals and their learning and families and whānau. The outdoor area is challenging and interesting. It has been carefully planned to support children’s physical development and to promote sustainable environmental practices. Children enjoy the opportunities to freely investigate materials, work with others and make choices about their learning.</p><p>The curriculum effectively integrates bicultural values and practices in authentic ways. Parents’ and whānau aspirations for their children are sought and valued. Promoting success for Māori children as Maori is a continuing focus. Established links with whānau and local Māori supports teachers’ practice.</p><p>Careful consideration is given to supporting children when they transition to primary school. Teachers’ approach is based on individual needs and is inclusive of whānau. A positive relationship has been developed with the adjacent school, which supports both children and whānau needs. The head teacher agrees she should continue to seek effective ways of sharing information about learners and school and early childhood programmes.</p><p>Strong community links and networks are established. Along with the association’s parent support project, these give some families and whānau access to help they may need for their children’s wellbeing and to enable their full participation at kindergarten. The association should continue to monitor needs to ensure sufficient levels of support are maintained for teachers, so they can provide equitable outcomes for children.</p><p>Individual portfolios record aspects of children’s participation and learning at kindergarten and useful information for parents and whānau about early learning. Development steps should include: increasing the focus on children’s significant learning moments ( including their working theories and development of learning dispositions); showing how their progress is being facilitated over time; and supporting parents’ and whānau contributions to the learning records.</p><p>Teachers show high levels of commitment to the kindergarten philosophy and support for each other. Their capability is built by opportunities to lead aspects of practice and through good head teacher leadership.</p><p>A useful appraisal process supports teachers to reflect on their practice in relation to professional teaching requirements. The association leadership team is in the process of implementing a revised approach across the association. This should include focused observations of teachers’ practice in relation to their professional goals. Once the new approach is fully implemented, evaluation of its impact on teachers’ development should be a next step for the association.</p><p>Teachers are highly reflective and regularly work together to review aspects of their practice. Developing the team’s understanding and use of internal evaluation should enhance decision making about change and improvement.</p><p>Kindergarten long-term plans strongly align with the association’s strategic priorities. The inclusion of priorities for children’s learning, identified by the kindergarten, should provide a stronger basis for developing and evaluating to determine how well practices promote improved outcomes for children.</p><p>The senior teacher provides a range of support for teaching teams. She is considering further developing her approach to giving feedback and reporting to better meet kindergarten needs.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The teaching team, with support from the association, should continue to develop its:</p><ul>
<li>approach to assessment to support planning for learning</li>
<li>understanding and use of internal evaluation to improve teaching and learning.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Barsanti Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Barsanti Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>2 December 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col><col><col></colgroup>

<li>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here:</a></li>
<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children. </li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
