</table><p>Chelsea House Levin is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Chelsea House Levin is a privately owned early learning service licensed to provide full day education and care for 73 children, including 23 up to the age of two years. Of the 81 currently enrolled, 27 identify as Māori and 12 are of Pacific heritage.</p><p>Since the February 2016 ERO report, a new centre manager has been appointed, who is also the licensee. She has overall responsibility for operation of the service and staff management, and is assisted by three senior teachers.</p><p>The service's philosophy emphasises respect and the value of trusting relationships within an inclusive and diverse environment, where children are given time and space to lead their learning. Social and emotional competence is encouraged.</p><p>The previous ERO report identified areas requiring further improvement. These included developing quality indicators of practice that reflect the philosophy, strengthening internal evaluation and enhancing the appraisal process. Progress is ongoing.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children benefit from a play-based programme that effectively nurtures their sense of wellbeing and belonging and invites exploration. Literacy and numeracy are integrated in meaningful ways. Openended questions are effectively use to promote children's thinking and extend their engagement in self-initiated play activities. Problem-solving, experimentation and creativity are carefully fostered. Teachers know children well and work alongside them to facilitate their play. The philosophy is clearly evident in practice.</p><p>Children with additional needs are well catered for. Families, external agencies and teachers collaborate to appropriately plan for their learning. Positive achievements are celebrated.</p><p>Infants and toddlers participate in a calm and unhurried environment. Consistent caregiving enables teachers to respond sensitively to each child's subtle cues, changing needs and preferences. Toddlers are provided with effective guidance to support their growing social competence.</p><p>Teachers appropriately acknowledge the importance of whakapapa and iwi to support Māori children's identity. They have continued to grow their knowledge of te ao Māori. The environment reflects the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand. Continuing to strengthen learning partnerships with whānau Māori should further support Māori children's success.</p><p>Consistency of teacher practice is a feature of the service and this has been effectively supported by leadership and internal professional development using self-review as an inquiry process. A focus on intentional teaching strategies is evident with teachers working collaboratively to provide high levels of support for children.</p><p>Parents have opportunities to contribute their perspectives to the centre curriculum. Teachers are aware of the need to continue to strengthen partnerships with parents.</p><p>Teachers are highly reflective and are aware of the improvement purpose of self review. Leaders have planned further professional development to strengthen shared understandings and the consistency of internal evaluation. ERO's evaluation confirms this direction.</p><p>Appraisal requires further strengthening to better reflect the Teaching Council's guidelines and should include links to the Standards for the Teaching Profession and formal observations of practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders and ERO agree that important priorities for ongoing development are to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>establish a clear appraisal procedure that meets Teaching Council guidelines</li>
<li>build internal evaluation capability to effectively measure the impact of systems and processes on outcomes for children</li>
<li>strengthen review of policies and procedures, to better reflect good quality practices already in place and identify whether further adaptation is needed.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Chelsea House Levin completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Actions for compliance</h3><p>ERO's evaluation identified areas of non-compliance about appraisal and the mitigation of risks for excursions. The service provider and governance must ensure that:</p><ul>
<li>the centre manager is fully appraised annually</li>
<li>full risk assessments are completed for each excursion and regular outings undertaken so that parents are well informed of any potential risk. <br><em>[Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008, GMA7, HS17]</em></li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Chelsea House Levin will be in three years.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Central Region</span></p><p>30 January 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 605px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
