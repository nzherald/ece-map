</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Don Buck Kindergarten is a well-established service that provides education and care for up to 40 children over two years old. The kindergarten operates sessions whose hours match those of schools. Some children attend for mornings only.</p><p>The centre is part of the Auckland Kindergarten Association (AKA) and operates within the policies and management framework of this organisation. A professional services manager (PSM) visits regularly and provides management and curriculum support for teachers. A parents’ support group has recently become re-established and provides valued support for teachers. The AKA has high expectations that teachers will provide a bicultural programme.</p><p>The head teacher has recently returned to the kindergarten after two years’ leave. The acting head teacher during this period was well supported by the AKA to lead the team and continue the development of the kindergarten. The teachers, who are all registered, have been engaged in professional development focused on deepening children's learning. They intend to use their knowledge from this course as they re-establish their team and review their philosophy and teaching practices.</p><p>In 2010 ERO identified strengths in the kindergarten. Children were independent learners and their early literacy was well supported. Teachers were an effective team and had strong relationships with families. They were considering strategies for extending children's learning, promoting bicultural practices, and enhancing partnerships with Māori whānau. The team has sustained good practices and is committed to ongoing improvements in the programme.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 10 kindergarten reviews in the Auckland Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children engage enthusiastically in play. They settle in areas of interest quickly, often sustaining their individual play or working collaboratively with others. They share positive relationships with teachers and their peers, frequently supporting each other when working in a group. Children know about making choices and benefit from opportunities to develop early literacy and mathematics knowledge in meaningful contexts. They are becoming familiar with aspects of te reo and tikanga Māori and many are able to introduce themselves confidently with a simple mihi.</p><p>Teachers work closely with children to support their play. They engage children in social conversation and guide learning by describing concepts, using open questions and prompting new ideas. They also expect children to work independently and pursue their own interests. Teachers foster tuakana-teina relationships, encouraging children to share their skills and understanding with others.</p><p>Teachers meet daily to discuss children's emerging interests. They document significant play in weekly plans that are prominently displayed. Teachers encourage parents and children to record comments on plans to guide ways of extending children's interests. Teachers use children's assessment portfolios well to analyse children's learning and demonstrate their teaching strategies. They monitor the contents of portfolios, and recognise that more evaluative reviews of their assessment processes would provide better information about the quality of children's learning.</p><p>Parents and whānau who were interviewed during the course of this review report that they appreciate the caring environment teachers provide. They value the multicultural community and opportunities for children to learn about New Zealand’s dual cultural heritage. Teachers listen well to parents’ aspirations and frequently talk to them about their child’s learning. Parents are enthusiastic about the high quality of resources, the enjoyable excursions provided for their children, and the strong support given to children making the transition to school.</p><p>The kindergarten is well managed. The acting head teacher has encouraged collaborative teamwork and teachers share responsibilities effectively. Teachers use electronic systems well to engage in reflective self review focused on improving outcomes for children. There are strong links between the Association’s strategic goals and the teachers’ annual plans. Appraisal goals are appropriately linked to achieving set targets. The PSM will provide support for the permanent head teacher as she catches up with team development and re-establishes herself in the leadership role.</p><p>The Auckland Kindergarten Association continues to provide strong governance for kindergartens. Positive strategies include effective professional learning and development that is responsive to strengthening teachers’ professional skills, knowledge and practice. Distributed leadership among kindergarten teaching teams is also promoted and the sharing of knowledge and expertise within the Association is encouraged. Association leaders are currently reviewing the appraisal process and continue to explore appropriate ways to support teachers and ensure high quality outcomes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The teachers, the PSM and ERO agree that the key next steps for kindergarten development should include teachers:</p><ul>
<li>continuing to develop their programme planning to strengthen links between their daily reflections and children’s subsequent learning experiences</li>
<li>enhancing teaching strategies to focus more on open questions that will further extend children's learning</li>
<li>continue to develop and add depth of reflection to self review.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Don Buck Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Don Buck Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>3 December 2014</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><ul>

</ul><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
