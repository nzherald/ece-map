</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Little Villa is a full-day licensed education and care service located in Ngongotaha. It is licensed to cater for 48 children, including 15 up to the age of two years in two age-based areas. At the time of this ERO review the roll was 58 of whom 37 children identify as Māori from Te Arawa descent.</p><p>The centre operates under the governance and management of Provincial Childcare which has eight other centres in the North Island. This management group took over ownership of this centre in 2014. The centre was previously known as Lake View Early Childhood Education Centre and this is the first ERO review under the new ownership. The service provider places priority on the provision of high-quality services and positive learning outcomes for children and their families.</p><p>Since the last ERO review and under new ownership, there have been considerable changes to centre management and staff. In addition, the service has experienced significant roll growth and the new owners have made major upgrades to the buildings and grounds.</p><p>The centre exceeds minimum Ministry of Education requirements in relation to the number of teachers with recognised qualifications and adult-to-children ratios.</p><p>The service prioritises respectful and nurturing relationships with children and their families and whānau. Management and teachers aim to foster curiosity, exploration, self responsibility and sustainable practices for children and their whānau.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The Provincial Childcare organisation provides effective governance and management for Little Villa. In a short time they have developed a clearly defined philosophy, strategic direction, and set policy and procedures to guide centre operations. A major focus for centre leaders has been to significantly improve the premises and playground, strengthen relationships with parents and whānau, and recruit qualified teachers. The centre directors and management team are committed to the provision of a high quality education and care service for parents and whānau from the local area. This priority is effectively supported by the guidance of professional leaders, and the professional learning and development programme along with teacher registration and appraisal processes.</p><p>Building leadership capability within this new team is a key strategic goal for centre development. All teachers are encouraged to take on leadership roles and this is fostering a shared leadership model. This practice is contributing to a positive team culture where teachers are working well together and the centre manager is providing effective direction and guidance.</p><p>Self review, particularly emergent self review, is a growing centre strength. This process is clearly focused on enhancing outcomes for children and strengthening teacher practice. Teachers and whānau actively participate in self review that has contributed to the growth and development of the service. A feature of the reviews is the strong bicultural focus that provides and promotes positive outcomes for Māori children and their whānau.</p><p>The centre’s curriculum priorities include:</p><ul>
<li>a strong bicultural dimension where children’s language, identity and culture are celebrated</li>
<li>clear connections to the dispositions and bicultural assessment within <em>Te Whatu Pokeka</em></li>
<li>a play-based programme where children’s interests and strengths are integral to their growth and development</li>
<li>connections with the local community including significant places, stories and tikanga of importance to Māori</li>
<li>children developing skills to support them to play cooperatively with their peers.</li>
</ul><p>Children up to the age of two are well catered for in a separate area of the service. Teachers are very caring and nurturing of these very young children, and provide a good range of activities for babies and toddlers to explore. Care routines are sensitively managed and are increasingly responsive to individual babies' rhythms and expectations.</p><p>The implementation of the centre curriculum is contributing to an environment where children are happy, trusting, confident and engaged in meaningful play and learning.</p><p>Teachers have established strong and close relationships with children and their whānau. They know and respect children and parents well, and use this information effectively to guide their interactions and plan the programme. Improvements to the environment and resourcing of the centre have enabled teachers to increase their ability to extend children’s learning. Teachers are also developing their skills to notice, recognise and respond to children’s interests and care needs. They spend sustained periods of time with children at play, and provide relevant activities and experiences to engage them in purposeful learning.</p><p>Teachers are developing an agreed system for assessment, planning and evaluation. They are currently exploring the use of a range of assessment resources including <em>Te Whāriki</em>, <em>Te Whatu Pokeka</em>, <em>Tātaiako</em>, <em>Ka Hikitia</em> and teacher registration criteria to design an assessment framework.</p><p>The centre has successfully established a culture where parents and whānau feel welcome, are happy to be involved, and participate and contribute to centre life. These partnerships are built on values such as whanaungatanga, manaakitanga as well as respect for each other and open communication. This has resulted in the strengthening of their partnerships for learning and a sense of belonging and community.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Further priorities for centre development include:</p><ul>
<li>strengthening strategic self review by utilizing the framework already developed for emergent self review</li>
<li>ensuring, through consultation, that teachers have input and ownership into the strategic plan</li>
<li>deepening teachers’ understanding and the use of the assessment tool <em>Te</em> <em>Whatu Pokeka</em> so that teachers are more effectively planning for children’s dispositions and learning, and intentional teaching practice</li>
<li>implementing personalised developmental plans for teachers so that individual appraisal goals are closely monitored and are aligned to the goals in the centre strategic plan.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Little Villa completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>Dianne Moffitt</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>16 July 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
