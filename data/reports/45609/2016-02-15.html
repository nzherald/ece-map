</tr></tbody></table><p>The service needs support to further develop the quality of the programme, learning environment and consistency in teaching practice.</p>
<p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Big Hugz Early Learning Centre Limited is a privately owned and operated centre offering all-day early childhood education and care. The centre is located in a converted house and an adjoining property in Hillcrest, Hamilton. The centre is licensed for mixed ages, with 39 children including 23 under two years of age. The centre operates two separate age-related areas. The current service roll at the time of this ERO review is 54 children providing for a diverse range of ethnicities, including Chinese and Māori.</p>
<p>The Big Hugz philosophy statement emphasises the role of parents and whānau as the first and most important educators of their children. The philosophy also gives priority to providing an environment that embraces all children and promotes the social and emotional development of each child. An important feature of the philosophy is the strong commitment to respect the dual heritage of Aotearoa/New Zealand together with many diverse cultures represented in the centre community.</p>
<p>Since the last ERO report in 2012, there have been significant changes to staffing and the leadership structure. At the time of this ERO review, the owner/service provider had assumed leadership for all aspects of professional practice, including supervision of both age-group areas, while retaining responsibility for centre management and administration. This report includes a recommendation to review leadership structures and give priority to addressing the issues remaining from the 2012 ERO report.</p>
<h3>The Review Findings</h3>
<p>Children experience affirming and mutually respectful relationships that foster a positive sense of wellbeing and belonging. They benefit from familiar routines that incorporate cultural values. This builds a sense of trust and confidence. Teachers develop productive partnerships with parents and whānau and these are based on genuine attitudes of acceptance, respect and value the cultural advantage that they bring. Teachers provide good quality language resources to support children’s first languages, including Chinese and Māori. The centre owner/service provider has developed a collegial team of staff that all work together in the best interests of children and their families.</p>
<p>Babies and toddlers enjoy a safe, secure area for play with access to an environment that is well resourced and encourages exploration. Designated staff support toddlers and babies who need strong attachments of trust and familiarity. They also maintain appropriate communication with parents about important daily routines. The next step is to review the programme to ensure routines suit the rhythms and needs of individual babies and toddlers.</p>
<p>Teachers plan, assess and evaluate the programme within long term themes such as family, sensory and communication. There is a deliberate link between centre and home experiences which includes special events that welcome and include families such as Mother’s Day, Father’s Day, Matariki and Chinese New Year. The programme reflects and values each child’s identity, language and culture. Bicultural perspectives and practices are also integrated into aspects of the daily programme.</p>
<p>The programme experienced by children is further extended through trips in the centre van to the local library, church and school visits. Children are well supported and make a valuable social contribution to sick children in the local hospital. Excursions to playgrounds and parks provide opportunities for more physical challenges as the outside area at the centre is limited.</p>
<p>Priority is given to providing equitable learning outcomes for all children. This includes providing support for daily transport where appropriate and the empathetic support of children with specific needs. Children’s involvement in the programme is well documented and illustrated in individual assessment portfolio’s that are shared with, and appreciated by children, parents and whānau.</p>
<p>The inside play areas are appropriately resourced with a focus on natural materials. Children have ongoing access to artistic and writing materials to support the development of early literacy skills. Teachers provide learning contexts for children to develop recognition of print, symbols and numbers. The centre provides a teacher-led programme for older children which is intended to support their transition to school. This programme includes specific practice in number, letter recognition and self-management skills. Reviewing the effectiveness of this programme should be considered to ensure it is achieving its goals. Providing an adequate teaching space for the 4 year old programme needs to be addressed to ensure it meets health and safety requirements.</p>
<p>The owner must now provide professional development for herself and teachers to further develop their understanding of current best practice in early childhood education. This should strengthen teacher practice and understanding of a child-centred curriculum. There needs to be:</p>
<ul><li>greater use of open-ended questions that respect children’s ideas, supports their exploration and extends their learning</li>
<li>priority given to learning through play and providing meaningful, purposeful contexts to develop mathematical and literacy concepts</li>
<li>more opportunities for children’s sustained and complex play, including opportunities for problem solving, and experimentation.</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps</h3>
<p>ERO recommends that consideration is given to reviewing current staffing arrangements to include the appointment of a head teacher. This should ensure shared responsibility for leadership and supervision of professional practice within the centre, and improve the consistency of educational practice by staff.</p>
<h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3>
<p>Before the review, the staff and management of Big Hugz Early Learning Centre Limited completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><h3>Actions for compliance</h3>
<p>ERO identified areas of non-compliance relating to legislative and health and safety requirements. To meet requirements the service needs to improve its performance in the following areas:</p>
<ul><li>develop an effective performance management system consistent with current legislative requirements of the Education Council, including the appraisal of the owner/manager</li>
<li>ensure the teaching space provided for the 4 year old programme meets health and safety standards and regulation (regulation 45)</li>
<li>ensure children have better access to the outdoor play area (regulation 45 Clause 7).</li>
</ul><p>Licensing Criteria for Early Childhood Education and Care Centres 2008.</p>
<h3>Development Plan Recommendation</h3>
<p>ERO recommends that the service consult with the Ministry of Education and plan to address the key next steps and actions outlined in this report.</p>
<p>These include:</p>
<ul><li>the review of current staffing and the appointment of a head teacher to provide adequate professional supervision of staff, and improve the quality of teaching practice</li>
<li>reviewing the provision of professional development for teachers that is focussed on current best practice in early childhood education</li>
<li>improving the outdoor environment to provide adequate opportunities for more extensive physical challenge, exploration and experimentation.</li>
</ul><p>There is an also a need to ensure an effective performance management system that is consistent with current legislative requirements of the Education Council is developed. The centre is currently working with an outside specialist and this should assist the centre to improve personnel requirements.</p>
<h3>Next ERO Review</h3>
<h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4>
<p>The next ERO review of Big Hugz Early Learning Centre Limited will be within two years.</p>

<h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3>
<p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p>

<h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3>
<p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here:</a></p>
<p><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p>
<p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p>
<p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p>
<p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p>
<p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p>
<h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3>
<p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p>
<ul><li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
