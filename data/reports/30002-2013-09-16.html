</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Hinuera Playcentre is a sessional centre providing education and care for children from birth to school age. The centre operates as a parent cooperative under the umbrella of the East Waikato Playcentre Association and is licensed for 30 children, including up to 15 under two years. At the time of this review 32 children were enrolled including four of Māori descent. Members are committed to providing a child-centred, free-play programme within a supportive family-friendly environment.</p><p>Since the last ERO review in 2010, two new supervisors have been employed to lead the sessions. The playcentre building has been extended and an all-day session operates on Mondays, with morning-only sessions for the rest of the week. The centre has been operating for many years and there are second generation children on the current roll.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 10 playcentre reviews in the East Waikato Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The East Waikato Playcentre Association provides an appropriate range of policies that have assisted the centre with the licensing process and to establish centre operational procedures. The association has implemented sound employment procedures when employing centre supervisors. However, the centre would benefit from an annual external appraisal process for the two paid supervisors. The association is not currently able to provide playcentre adult education, making engagement in course work difficult for members.</p><p>Centre leaders and members have established clear roles and take shared responsibility for centre operations. A good proportion of members have playcentre qualifications. Parents work well as a team and experienced members foster emergent leadership and mentor new members. The supervisors bring a wide range of knowledge and skills to enrich the centre programme and ensure continuity of learning for children. Together with centre members, they plan specific programmes with a mixture of child-initiated play and teacher-led topics. This programme is extended through trips to places of interest and regular celebrations such as birthdays and seasonal festivals. Centre members now need to develop an effective self-review programme that informs strategic planning.</p><p>A well-maintained and carefully presented learning environment provides generous spaces for children’s active play and exploration of the natural world. The new building extension has significantly improved the learning and care environment for adults and children. The centre is well equipped with a wide variety of high-quality equipment that is easily accessed by children. A feature of the centre is the emphasis on providing rich literacy and numeracy learning experiences through centre displays, books and the programme. An attractive area for babies and toddlers has been established and provides a safe place for them to play.</p><p>Parents have created a warm and friendly environment where a strong sense of belonging and well being is highly evident. Children play well in mixed-age groups. They confidently interact with other children and adults. Routines are flexible to meet children’s individual needs, while providing a familiar structure to the all-day session. Parents encourage children to engage in their imaginative and dramatic play, and work alongside them to support and provide positive guidance.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre members and ERO agree that consideration should now be given to strengthening the programme by:</p><ul>
<li>further inclusion of Māori perspectives to reflect the bicultural nature of New Zealand society</li>
<li>extending learning in play through more in-depth conversations and open questioning that encourages problem solving and thinking skills</li>
<li>reviewing the content of individual portfolios to ensure they are of a consistent quality, reflective of their progress and development, and are readily accessible for children to revisit and share.</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends that the East Waikato Association undertakes regular and rigorous external appraisal of the employed supervisors as part of their performance management process.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Hinuera Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Hinuera Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>16 September 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category.
