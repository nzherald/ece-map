</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Allenton Kindergarten provides early childhood education for children two-to-five years of age. The kindergarten is licensed for up to 40 children. Children participate in half or whole day learning programmes, running from 8.30am to 2.30pm. Children come from diverse cultural backgrounds.</p><p>The vision for all children is that they will develop:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>respect for self, others and the environment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the dispositions for lifelong learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>self-confidence and self esteem</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a positive cultural identity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>connections with the local community</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>complexity in their understandings of the world around them.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Allenton Kindergarten is one of five kindergartens administered by the Ashburton Kindergarten Association (AKA). A manager oversees the association, under the governance of a board. An education specialist is contracted to give professional advice and guidance on teaching and learning. The day-to-day operation of the kindergarten is managed by a head teacher, supported by three qualified early childhood teachers.</p><p>Since the May 2014 ERO review, the kindergarten has made good progress in responding to the areas identified for development, including strengthening the quality and consistency of assessment practices and monitoring the impact of changes to practice on outcomes for children.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of five kindergartens reviewed in the AKA. The association is a member of the Hakatere Kāhui Ako|Community of Learning (CoL).</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are very effectively supported to develop the valued outcomes identified in the kindergarten's vision. ERO observed children who were highly engaged for sustained periods of time in a wide range of purposeful learning activities. Children demonstrated effective communication and social skills in the way they played with and alongside each other. Many children were confidently leading their own learning.</p><p>Teachers draw on current theories of teaching, learning and child development to design a rich and responsive curriculum. They pay close attention to children's interests and developing abilities and plan learning opportunities and teaching strategies that encourage children to take risks with and extend their learning. Teachers ensure all children have access to the breadth of the curriculum.</p><p>Children are supported to develop a sense of confidence and belonging in their local community and environment through frequent visits to the local school and other sites of interest. Teachers use these visits to build on children's understandings about the world around them and to support their transitions to school.</p><p>Children benefit from having access to an attractive, well-resourced learning environment which has been carefully designed to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>encourage exploration, problem solving and creativity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>provide physical challenge</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>support children to revisit past learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>celebrate children's cultures.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Shared understandings of key Māori and Pacific values have been thoughtfully developed in partnership with whānau, aiga and iwi. These are meaningfully integrated into programmes and practices.</p><p>Teachers build warm, respectful and reciprocal relationships with children's parents and wider families. They welcome and encourage families' contributions to what teachers know about their children, programmes, visits and activities and to decisions about what is important learning in the kindergarten.</p><p>High quality teaching and learning practices have been well sustained over time through effective leadership, ongoing self review for improvement and teachers' active engagement in professional learning. The head teacher promotes a shared understanding of the kindergarten's vision and goals amongst teachers and children's families. She fosters collaborative ways of working and a culture in which children are seen as confident, capable learners. Self review is well planned, systematic and leads to changes in teaching practice. The teaching team has quickly engaged with the recently revised early learning curriculum (Te Whāriki 2017) and is building deep understandings about the concepts and theories that inform it.</p><p>To further strengthen the rigour of self review, ERO suggested the use of purposeful sampling of teacher practice and/or children's learning outcomes as a way of showing the impact of changes in teacher practice. This is encouraged in the recently updated Kidsfirst internal evaluation framework.</p><p>The Ashburton Kindergarten Association's vision and strategic goals are well known and reflected in individual kindergarten annual plans. The association has a sound policy and procedure framework in place to provide guidance for kindergarten operations and the monitoring of health and safety. The quality of teaching and learning in each kindergarten is regularly evaluated by the contracted education specialists. These evaluations are detailed and inform association planning and resourcing. Leaders and teachers have access to relevant professional development and leadership support. The association actively supports equity of outcomes for children by funding additional teaching resource and a speech-language therapist to support work with children with additional needs.</p><p>The association has made some progress in addressing the areas for development from ERO's 2014 review. This includes supporting a number of leaders and teachers to participate in professional learning about culturally responsive teaching practice. Supporting cultural responsiveness continues to be an area of focus for the association, given the growing diversity of kindergarten rolls.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>To continue to build on existing very good practice, ERO discussed the following next steps for Allenton Free KIndergarten:</p><ul>
<li>that leaders and teachers gather and analyse a range of practice data to strengthen the evidence base for internal evaluations.</li>
</ul><p>The association board, manager and ERO agree that aspects of governance can be improved by:</p><ul>
<li>strengthening planning for strategic and annual goals, including identifying relevant measures for knowing about the implementation and impact of goals</li>
<li>better aligning reporting from kindergartens and Kidsfirst education specialists with annual goals, in order to know about the implementation and impact of goals</li>
<li>improving monitoring of planning for, and outcomes for, priority learners across the association</li>
<li>building the internal evaluation capability of head teachers and teachers, particularly around the collection and analysis of evidence of practice.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Allenton Free Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Allenton Free Kindergarten will be in four years.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review &amp; Improvement Services Southern</p><p><span>Te Waipounamu - Southern Region</span></p><p>7 September 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
