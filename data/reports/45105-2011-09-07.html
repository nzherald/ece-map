<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</span></h2>
<p>Bear Park Centre of Learning &ndash; Kiwi is situated in Remuera, Auckland. The centre shares purpose-built premises with two adjoining licences that collectively provide education and care services for children between three months and five years of age. The Kiwi centre caters for children aged between approximately two and five years of age.</p>
<p>This is the first ERO report for the centre, which opened in 2009 and operates as part of the Bear Park group. The management team provides skilled professional support to ensure that operational systems are maintained to a high standard. Managers work effectively with teaching staff to integrate the Reggio Emilia philosophy with Te Wh&#257;riki, New Zealand&rsquo;s early childhood curriculum.</p>
<p>Children make choices for themselves and participate enthusiastically in a variety of learning experiences. Their purposeful engagement in play ensures that they settle quickly into the programme and take opportunities to actively explore the environment. They are capable and independent learners who show skill in managing interactions with their peers, displaying respect and care for others. Children are confident communicators who eagerly share their knowledge and ideas with teachers and other children.</p>
<p>Teachers interact with children in warm, caring and affirming ways. They know the children and their families well. The centre philosophy is reflected in teaching practices and respectful interactions are a positive feature of the centre. Teachers provide opportunities for children to develop knowledge and understanding through interactions that prompt investigation and collaboration. They work collaboratively to plan for and assess children&rsquo;s learning.</p>
<p>As a next step, ERO, the licensee and centre managers agree that managers and teachers could continue to use self review to further enhance learning outcomes for children.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p>
<a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2>
<h3>The Focus of the Review</h3>
<p>Before the review, the management of Bear Park Centre of Learning - Kiwi was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p>
<p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atBear Park Centre of Learning - Kiwi.</p>
<p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p>
<ul><li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p>
<h3>The Quality of Education</h3>
<p>This the first ERO review of Bear Park Centre of Learning &ndash; Kiwi. The owners and managers have developed a well resourced learning environment and have implemented learning programmes that provide a combination of the Reggio Emilia philosophy and the Te Wh&#257;riki curriculum.</p>
<h4>Areas of strength</h4>
<p>Positive outcomes for children. Children are happy and settled in the centre. They are confident and capable learners who:</p>
<ul><li>share their ideas, opinions and out of centre experiences to direct and sustain their own play</li>
<li>engage in purposeful and imaginative play</li>
<li>capably articulate their needs to teachers</li>
<li>are competent, independent and responsible learners</li>
<li>assertively manage their interactions with others</li>
<li>are forming strong friendships.</li>
</ul><p>Teaching and learning practices. Teachers&rsquo; interactions with children are affirming, warm and respectful. Teachers support and prompt children&rsquo;s sense of responsibility for their own behaviour. Their good teaching skills include:</p>
<ul><li>making children aware of clear expectations for their participation in the programme</li>
<li>listening responsively to children</li>
<li>providing opportunities for sustained group learning and revisiting learning experiences</li>
<li>knowing children and their families well</li>
<li>modelling language to facilitate the development of negotiation skills</li>
<li>working inclusively with children.</li>
</ul><p>Partnerships with parents. The centre has developed a strong partnership with parents to support children&rsquo;s learning. Parents report that they are well informed about the programme and that teachers are responsive to any concerns. They have opportunities to enjoy workshops and social events with staff and other families. They speak regularly with staff and have more formal opportunities for discussion at parent/teacher interviews. Teachers also provide information about children through online contact. The parent committee provides a further opportunity for parents to make suggestions about the programme.</p>
<p>Centre philosophy. The centre environment reflects the Italian-based Reggio Emilia learning philosophy within a New Zealand context. Elements of nature are well integrated in indoor and outdoor settings. Aesthetically pleasing and purposeful environments engage children&rsquo;s interest and exploration. Teachers support the development of children&rsquo;s social skills. Learning about literacy, numeracy, carpentry and tikanga M&#257;ori is promoted and celebrated in displays. Spaces are provided for children to display carpentry projects and to develop their work over time. Families can view and contribute ideas to support this work. Parents appreciate the home-like environments that have been achieved throughout the centre.</p>
<p>Group programme planning. Teachers are reflective and evaluative planners who thoughtfully consider how they can support children&rsquo;s learning. They provide attractive and informative records about children&rsquo;s learning and make them accessible to children and parents. Clear programme planning guidelines include observations of children engaged in the programme, learning stories that evaluate children&rsquo;s learning, collaborative teacher daily diaries and investigation books that focus on group learning experiences. Parents have opportunities to contribute ideas and comments about their children&rsquo;s leaning in learning stories or through interactive displays.</p>
<h4>Areas for development and review</h4>
<p>Individual programme planning. A large focus of the curriculum is on children&rsquo;s group learning through centre-wide investigations. Children&rsquo;s individual learning is often identified within the context of the investigation being explored. Teachers know children and their specific interests well, and could strengthen programme records by making individual interests evident in documentation. Learning stories could be used to identify learning goals and to involve children in decisions about how their interests could be extended.</p>
<p>Strengthening interactions. Teachers could more frequently use open-ended questions to extend children&rsquo;s learning and enrich children&rsquo;s thinking. It would be useful for experienced teachers to model good questioning techniques for other team members.</p>
<h3>The Quality of Management</h3>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>Bear Park Centre of Learning &ndash; Kiwi is part of the Bear Park group. The three licences on the Remuera site operate under the comprehensive management systems that support all Bear Park Centres. The three Remuera centres opened in 2009 and are licensed under the 2008 Early Childhood Licensing Criteria.</p>
<h4>Areas of strength</h4>
<p>Professional leadership. Effective management practices are implemented by a capable and knowledgeable leadership team. The licensee and managers have worked collaboratively to develop a highly motivated team that has a clear emphasis on providing a high quality learning programme for children and is committed to ongoing improvement in all areas of centre operations.</p>
<p>Management systems. Bear Park management systems have been quickly embedded in centre practices and are evident in:</p>
<ul><li>regular reviews of centre policies and procedures</li>
<li>maintenance of health, safety and hazard management requirements</li>
<li>systems that enable effective management of centre finances</li>
<li>well developed personnel systems, including teacher appraisal processes</li>
<li>provision of professional development opportunities, including support and guidance programmes for provisionally registered teachers</li>
<li>parent surveys and committee meetings that enable parents to provide managers with feedback on the programme.</li>
</ul><h4>Areas for development and review</h4>
<p>Ongoing improvement. To enhance existing high quality practices, centre managers could consider:</p>
<ul><li>reviewing strategic and annual goals to strengthen learning outcomes for children</li>
<li>including more measurable goals in teacher appraisals so that teachers are encouraged to reflect on and further develop their teaching practice.</li>
</ul><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. National Evaluation Topic</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p>
<h3>Partnerships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children in early childhood services</h3>
<p>As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p>
<ul><li>this service understands and values the identity, language and culture of M&#257;ori children and their wh&#257;nau, particularly when the child and wh&#257;nau transition to the service</li>
<li>managers and educators have built relationships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children</li>
<li>this service works in partnership with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children.</li>
</ul><h3>Background</h3>
<p>Currently six children of M&#257;ori heritage are enrolled in this service. Transitions into the centre are managed effectively and families are encouraged to participate in transition processes. Parents report that they value opportunities to meet individually with teachers to discuss their children&rsquo;s progress and to participate in centre events and social occasions.</p>
<h4>Areas of strength</h4>
<p>M&#257;ori culture in centre planning and practices. Teachers recognise the importance of affirming the culture and language of M&#257;ori children and their wh&#257;nau and use te reo M&#257;ori and waiata in their everyday practice. They actively consult parents and wh&#257;nau about their aspirations for their children and reflect this information in programme planning and implementation. Teachers are eager to increase their understanding of M&#257;ori language and culture and to use it to enrich the programme.</p>
<h4>Areas for development and review</h4>
<p>Continuingto develop meaningful relationships. Managers and teachers could use their strength in building relationships with families to make meaningful connections with M&#257;ori wh&#257;nau. They could also use the Ministry of Education&rsquo;s M&#257;ori education strategy, Ka Hikitia, as a tool for identifying ways of promoting success for M&#257;ori children as M&#257;ori learners.</p>

<p>Before the review, the staff of Bear Park Centre of Learning - Kiwi completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><a id="5-recommendations" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>5. Recommendations</h2>
<p>ERO and the centre managers agree that:</p>
<p>5.1 managers and teachers could continue to use self review to further enhance learning outcomes for children</p>
<p>5.2 planning for children&rsquo;s individual interests and ongoing learning could be more clearly evident in programme records.</p>
<a id="6-future-action" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>6. Future Action</h2>
<p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p>

<p>To the Parents and Community of Bear Park Centre of Learning - Kiwi</p>
<p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Bear Park Centre of Learning - Kiwi.</p>
<p>Bear Park Centre of Learning &ndash; Kiwi is situated in Remuera, Auckland. The centre shares purpose-built premises with two adjoining licences that collectively provide education and care services for children between three months and five years of age. The Kiwi centre caters for children aged between approximately two and five years of age.</p>
<p>This is the first ERO report for the centre, which opened in 2009 and operates as part of the Bear Park group. The management team provides skilled professional support to ensure that operational systems are maintained to a high standard. Managers work effectively with teaching staff to integrate the Reggio Emilia philosophy with Te Wh&#257;riki, New Zealand&rsquo;s early childhood curriculum.</p>
<p>Children make choices for themselves and participate enthusiastically in a variety of learning experiences. Their purposeful engagement in play ensures that they settle quickly into the programme and take opportunities to actively explore the environment. They are capable and independent learners who show skill in managing interactions with their peers, displaying respect and care for others. Children are confident communicators who eagerly share their knowledge and ideas with teachers and other children.</p>
<p>Teachers interact with children in warm, caring and affirming ways. They know the children and their families well. The centre philosophy is reflected in teaching practices and respectful interactions are a positive feature of the centre. Teachers provide opportunities for children to develop knowledge and understanding through interactions that prompt investigation and collaboration. They work collaboratively to plan for and assess children&rsquo;s learning.</p>
<p>As a next step, ERO, the licensee and centre managers agree that managers and teachers could continue to use self review to further enhance learning outcomes for children.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p>
<p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p>
<p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p>

<h3>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h3>
<h4>About ERO</h4>
<p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p>
<h3>About ERO Reviews</h3>
<p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p>
<ul><li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p>
<h3>Review Focus</h3>
<p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p>
<p>Quality of Education &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</p>
<p>Additional Review Priorities &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</p>
<p>National Evaluation Topics &ndash; This strand contributes to the development of education policies and their effective implementation. The information from this strand is aggregated by ERO for its national evaluation reports. Topics for investigation are changed regularly to provide up-to-date information.</p>
<p>Compliance with Legal Requirements &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</p>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p>
<h3>Review Recommendations</h3>
<p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p>
