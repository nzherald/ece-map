</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Paikea Kindergarten is adjacent to school grounds in Whangara, Gisborne. It provides both part and full time education and care for children from 2 years to school age Monday to Thursday. At the time of this ERO review, 20 children are enrolled, 7 of whom are Māori.</p><p>The centre philosophy is underpinned by five key learning areas: 'Kia Maia' to be brave; 'Rangatiratanga' leadership; 'Turangawaewae' to develop knowledge of who they are; 'Manaakitanga' to establish and maintain relationships; and to explore and make meaning.</p><p>A head teacher oversees the day to day operation of the centre. All teachers are fully qualified. Over the past three years staff have participated in professional learning provided by the Gisborne Kindergarten Association (the association) which has included Te Ao Māori, working with younger children and assessment, planning and evaluation.</p><p>Paikea Kindergarten is one of 11 kindergartens governed and managed by the association. Two senior teachers provide ongoing professional support and guidance to individual kindergartens. A pouawhina has been appointed on a fixed term contract to guide kindergartens' implementation of tikanga and kaupapa Māori practices.</p><p>The September 2014 ERO report identified an area for review and development at kindergarten level, to refine their evaluative practices. Very good progress has been made in this area. At the association level, it was identified that they should undertake strategic self review. Progress is ongoing.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 10 reviews in the Gisborne Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children confidently engage in an inspiring play-based, child-led curriculum. Interactions are highly respectful, responsive and fun. Children's independence, leadership, sense of belonging and identity and empowerment effectively guide and contribute to their learning. They have opportunities to lead, and challenge themselves to take risks.</p><p>A highly effective place-based curriculum celebrating and valuing the uniqueness of Whangara-mai Tawhiti is a strength. Teachers deliberately weave a range of exciting kaupapa Māori concepts thoughtfully into the programme. Respecting tikanga and kawa practices are well understood and promoted through regular excursions to the local marae and places of significance to hapū and iwi.</p><p>Well-established learning partnerships support very effective, culturally responsive teaching practices, for Māori learners. Te reo and waiata Māori are successfully integrated in the programme. Leaders and teachers show a strong commitment to valuing Māori children’s identity as Māori as the foundation for and a key to their success as Māori.</p><p>Collaboration with whānau and parents informs a robust cycle of assessment, planning and evaluation. Teachers and whānau work in partnership to develop specific learning goals that align to the five key learning areas that underpin the valued outcomes of the centre’s philosophy. This information is woven into individualised support and documentation of children’s interests, skills, dispositions, and progress.</p><p>Internal evaluation is well established and highly valued. Leaders and teachers inquire into and measure how well their practices, programmes, and processes contribute to children experiencing positive learning outcomes. The centre has identified that consolidating their evaluation processes and their reasoning for improvement is a key next step. ERO's evaluation confirms this.</p><p>There is a well-considered approach to support children’s sense of belonging as they transition into the kindergarten and on to school. This is supported by effective relationships with the teachers, parents, whānau and the local school.</p><p>Leaders and teachers show an ongoing commitment to improving the quality of education and care for children. They establish a culture in which children are first and foremost valued, celebrated and affirmed for who they are, and what they and their whānau bring to their learning.</p><p>Teachers are well supported to develop their practice. There is a strong commitment to growing staff through ongoing professional learning and sharing of good practice. Senior teachers regularly identify actions and provoke thinking in relation to children's learning. The newly developed appraisal system should be fully implemented to strengthen teacher inquiry into their own practice.</p><p>Association leaders have a well-considered approach to progressing strategic objectives. Connections to the community are strong and maintaining these continues to be a focus. Leaders are committed to Treaty based partnerships and acknowledging Māori as Tangata Whenua. The association has identified that developing a shared understanding of internal evaluation is a priority. ERO's evaluation confirms this.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and kindergarten leaders agree that the priority is to continue to inquire into and evaluate the impact of kindergarten programmes and practices on children's outcomes.</p><p>The association should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>fully implement the new appraisal system</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to develop shared understanding and use of internal evaluation across all levels.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Paikea Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Paikea Kindergarten will be in four years.</p><p>Patricia Davey</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Pokapū - Central Region</span></p><p>24 May 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 605px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i></a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
