<p align="left">Johnsonville West Kindergarten is affiliated to the Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is the licensed service provider contact person for the kindergarten. The association employs a team of senior teachers, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support and advice and guidance to the teaching team. She also liaises with the kindergarten community.</p>
<p align="left">Children enthusiastically engage with a wide range of learning experiences within an attractive and spacious setting. They demonstrate confidence and high levels of independence.</p>
<p align="left">Adults&rsquo; interactions with children are positive and encouraging. Their conversations are interesting and challenging. Children&rsquo;s relationships with each other are harmonious and cooperative. Teachers model negotiation skills to support children&rsquo;s social competencies.</p>
<p align="left">Literacy and numeracy concepts are successfully promoted throughout the programme. Children&rsquo;s developing understandings are enriched through meaningful learning experiences and the provision of a stimulating and well-resourced environment.</p>
<p align="left">Families and wh&#257;nau are warmly welcomed and well informed about their children&rsquo;s learning and development. Discussions occur regularly between teachers and parents. Well-presented portfolios and wall displays document children&rsquo;s engagement in learning. Their developing competencies are given significance and value.</p>
<p align="left">The integration of a bicultural perspective is evident in all aspects of teaching and learning. Resources and displays enable children to develop a positive understanding of their heritage. Children from other diverse cultures are welcomed in their home languages.</p>
<p align="left">ERO identified, and management and staff agreed, that the teachers should make their role more visible in responding to and facilitating children&rsquo;s ongoing learning. ERO also suggested that teachers review and question the purpose of their end of morning routines to minimise the interruption of children&rsquo;s engagement in the curriculum.</p>
<p align="left">Johnsonville West Kindergarten is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p align="left">ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p>
<a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2>
<h3>The Focus of the Review</h3>
<p align="left">Before the review, the management of Johnsonville West Kindergarten was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p>
<p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atJohnsonville West Kindergarten.</p>
<p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p>
<ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">In addition, ERO decided to evaluate:</p>
<ul>
<li>association support</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p>
<h3>The Quality of Education</h3>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p align="left">Since the May 2008 ERO review, teachers have continued to refine self-review processes following the Ministry of Education guidelines Ng&#257; Arohaehae Whai Hua and through advice and support from the senior teacher.</p>
<h4>Areas of strength</h4>
<p align="left">Self review effectively guides decision making to improve practice, providing positive outcomes for children. Teachers are reflective and collaborative team members encouraged and guided by an experienced head teacher.</p>
<p align="left">Children enthusiastically engage in an exciting and motivating curriculum, responsive to their strengths, interests and experiences. They demonstrate confidence and high levels of independence. Literacy and numeracy learning opportunities are integrated throughout the programme and interactions.</p>
<p align="left">Learning and development are celebrated through thoughtfully presented profiles, capturing the individuality of each child, their culture, developing friendships and learning progress. Assessment information focuses on enhancing learning dispositions as well as the acquisition of skills and knowledge. Parents contribute through comments and stories from home.</p>
<p align="left">The integration of a bicultural perspective is evident in all aspects of teaching and learning. Resources and displays enable children to develop a positive understanding of their heritage. Teachers frequently use te reo M&#257;ori in their interactions with children and incorporate waiata and karakia into daily experiences<b>.</b> A weekly kapa haka session is led by a specialist teacher.</p>
<p align="left">Children from other diverse cultures are welcomed in their home languages. Traditional ethnic materials and artefacts are displayed and valued.</p>
<p align="left">Adults&rsquo; interactions with children are positive and encouraging. Their conversations with children are interesting and challenging. Teachers are attuned to the variety of ways children express and explore their theories and use a range of specific intentional strategies to encourage the development of these ideas. Inclusive practice is highly evident. Teachers recognise and respect children&rsquo;s different personalities, talents and interests.</p>
<p align="left">Children&rsquo;s relationships with each other are harmonious and cooperative. Teachers model negotiation skills to support children&rsquo;s social competencies.</p>
<p align="left">Strong, responsive and reciprocal relationships are formed with each family, supporting children&rsquo;s sense of belonging. Wh&#257;nau are warmly welcomed, their contribution and expertise are valued. Transition to contributing schools is a supportive process for children and wh&#257;nau. Relationships formed with new entrant teachers help families to be confident about their children&rsquo;s next step in education.</p>
<p align="left"><span>Since the previous ERO review, extensions and alterations to the environment have enhanced children&rsquo;s play and sense of challenge. Children successfully develop curiosity and keen interest as they participate in the play opportunities available both indoors and out. Easily accessible and high quality resources facilitate individuals&rsquo; ongoing awareness and learning. The atmosphere is generally relaxed and calm. Children confidently make satisfying educational choices and</span> take pleasure in investigating their environment.</p>
<h4>Areas for development and review</h4>
<p align="left">Teacher assessment of children&rsquo;s learning includes contribution by parents, teachers and children. ERO identified, and management and staff agreed, that the teachers should make their role more visible, through documentation, in responding to and facilitating children&rsquo;s ongoing learning.</p>
<p align="left">Teachers should review and question the purpose of their end of morning routines. They need to ensure that children&rsquo;s developing concentration, perseverance and engagement in the curriculum are not interrupted, losing the learning momentum.</p>
<h3>Association Support</h3>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p align="left">The 2008 ERO review of the association identified several strengths, including the provision of professional development, sound operation plans, support for property development and the use of a range of communication strategies to keep teachers and communities informed. Areas for improvement included the quality and depth of the written feedback given to teachers by the senior teacher and strengthening the appraisal process.</p>
<p align="left">Since 2008, the association has led consultation with the community to modify session times and improve the ratio of teachers to children from 1:15 to 1:10 and maintained its policy of employing qualified, registered teachers in regulated permanent positions.</p>
<p align="left">The association provides expectations and guidance to the kindergarten through its strategic plan, policies and procedures and more recently, the professional development strategy Te Manawa: Criteria for Curriculum Implementation.</p>
<h4>Areas of strength</h4>
<p align="left">The association continues to provide high levels of guidance and support to teachers for the continuous improvement of teaching and learning. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>the strategic plan setting expectations for participation, parent/wh&#257;nau involvement and quality teaching practices</li>
<li>clearly defined indicators of quality teaching and learning practice through Te&nbsp;Manawa</li>
<li>a wide range of professional development opportunities</li>
<li>ongoing support in property development, human resource management, finance and resourcing.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Areas for development and review</h4>
<p align="left">The association, senior teachers and ERO have identified areas where the association can strengthen its support for teachers. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>further developing and supporting leadership, including a review of the appraisal process</li>
<li>reviewing senior teacher documentation to show how teachers have improved their practice, as a result of feedback</li>
<li>reviewing how kindergartens&rsquo; annual plans for teaching and learning could more explicitly show how teachers respond to the association&rsquo;s strategic priorities.</li>
</ul>
<a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2>
<p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Johnsonville West Kindergarten completed an ERO CentreAssurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p>
<ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>

<a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-johnsonville-west-kindergarten" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Johnsonville West Kindergarten</h2>
<p align="left">These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Johnsonville West Kindergarten.</p>
<p align="left">Johnsonville West Kindergarten is affiliated to the Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is the licensed service provider contact person for the kindergarten. The association employs a team of senior teachers, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support and advice and guidance to the teaching team. She also liaises with the kindergarten community.</p>
<p align="left">Children enthusiastically engage with a wide range of learning experiences within an attractive and spacious setting. They demonstrate confidence and high levels of independence.</p>
<p align="left">Adults&rsquo; interactions with children are positive and encouraging. Their conversations are interesting and challenging. Children&rsquo;s relationships with each other are harmonious and cooperative. Teachers model negotiation skills to support children&rsquo;s social competencies.</p>
<p align="left">Literacy and numeracy concepts are successfully promoted throughout the programme. Children&rsquo;s developing understandings are enriched through meaningful learning experiences and the provision of a stimulating and well-resourced environment.</p>
<p align="left">Families and wh&#257;nau are warmly welcomed and well informed about their children&rsquo;s learning and development. Discussions occur regularly between teachers and parents. Well-presented portfolios and wall displays document children&rsquo;s engagement in learning. Their developing competencies are given significance and value.</p>
<p align="left">The integration of a bicultural perspective is evident in all aspects of teaching and learning. Resources and displays enable children to develop a positive understanding of their heritage. Children from other diverse cultures are welcomed in their home languages.</p>
<p align="left">ERO identified, and management and staff agreed, that the teachers should make their role more visible in responding to and facilitating children&rsquo;s ongoing learning. ERO also suggested that teachers review and question the purpose of their end of morning routines to minimise the interruption of children&rsquo;s engagement in the curriculum.</p>
<p align="left">Johnsonville West Kindergarten is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p>
<h3>Future Action</h3>
<p align="left">ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p>
<p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p>
<p align="left">If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.&nbsp;</p>

<a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2>
<h3>About ERO</h3>
<p align="left">ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p>
<h3>About ERO Reviews</h3>
<p align="left">ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p>
<h3>Review Focus</h3>
<p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Quality of Education</b> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><b>Additional Review Priorities</b> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><b>Compliance with Legal Requirements</b> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Review Coverage</h3>
<p align="left">ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p>
<h3>Review Recommendations</h3>
<p align="left">Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
