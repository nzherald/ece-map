</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Learning Curves Childcare Centre No 2 is one of two privately owned and operated services in west Auckland. The owner is well known to teachers, parents and children. Learning Curves No 2 caters for 28 children from two to five years of age for extended day education and care. The centre operates in a converted suburban house with a large back garden. Recent renovations and improvements have made the property more accessible for parents and children and space in the playground can now be used more efficiently.</p><p>ERO’s 2011 report noted good quality practices in teaching and learning, and strong, affirming relationships with families. The report recommended that assessment and planning processes and self review could be further developed and that there should be renewed efforts to involve parents in their children’s education.</p><p>The overarching philosophy for the centre promotes acceptance and support for all cultures. The centre serves a community that encompasses families from varied ethnicities.</p><p>Many of the teachers have worked in the service for considerable periods. Two fully registered teachers lead the team and others are working towards registration. The philosophy recognises <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and <em>Kei Tua o te Pae</em>, an assessment and planning document, as guidelines for good practice.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are trusting and confident with teachers. They are warmly welcomed into the inclusive environment in the centre and settle easily to play in friendly, self chosen groups. Strong transition programmes are in place and the tone is calm and cheerful. Teachers make a point of engaging with parents, and relationships are open and affirming.</p><p>Teachers continue to develop bicultural programmes. ERO’s 2011 report acknowledged the centre’s commitment to Māori learners by valuing their heritage and language. The te reo me ngā tikanga Māori focus means that children recognise and respond appropriately to teachers’ conversations. Although the centre has limited numbers of children from Pacific cultures, teachers are aware of the need to support these children in similar ways. Good connections with support agencies are in place to support teachers to work effectively with all children.</p><p>Teachers provide programmes that help children to become capable and confident learners. Children gain increased awareness of their environment and community as a result of frequent and planned outings and excursions. New ideas for working with children to extend their learning are being trialled and will continue in 2014. Teachers ensure that excursions are linked to the current interests of children.</p><p>The centre has recently undergone a period of change. The owner and lead teacher are working towards a fresh start this year. Professional development and additional support for teachers have been planned to promote high quality programmes. Teachers use self-review processes to investigate and improve programmes.</p><p>Management of the centre is efficient and well organised. Personnel policies and procedures reflect current legislation and provide opportunities for teachers to identify their next learning steps. The owner provides opportunities for leadership and delegates responsibility within a supportive framework. Leadership within the centre reflects a commitment to high quality programmes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre managers identified the next steps for the centre could include continuing to:</p><ul>
<li>strengthen self review, particularly of curriculum, including assessment and planning</li>
<li>sufficiently challenge children through knowledge of their interests</li>
<li>redevelop transition to school programmes and contacts.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Learning Curves Childcare Centre No 2 completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Learning Curves Childcare Centre No 2 will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>7 March 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
