</table><p>Central Kids Kindergartens - Morrinsville is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Central Kids Kindergartens - Morrinsville is located in the rural township of Morrinsville. It is licensed for 40 children over the age of two years. Currently there are 52 children enrolled with 12 who identify as Māori.</p><p>The kindergarten’s philosophy places value on children learning through play using the framework of <em>Te Whāriki</em>. They aim to include Te Tiriti o Waitangi principles and reflect these in the programme. Teachers believe children should be empowered to drive their own learning and support them to develop their creativity, imagination and resilience.</p><p>Since the ERO review in 2015, the experienced teaching team has remained consistent. The kindergarten has a positive ERO reporting history and since the 2015 ERO review they have further strengthened internal evaluation, and assessment practices.</p><p>The kindergarten operates under the governance and management of the Central North Island Kindergarten Trust, a community not-for-profit organisation. The overarching philosophy of the organisation is to provide kindergartens where children learn through play and are supported to reach their potential.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 10 kindergarten reviews in the Central North Island Kindergarten Trust.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children and their families enjoy close, respectful and trusting relationships with teachers. Together teachers and children have fun as part of the learning process. Children have established friendships and regularly support each other in learning through tuakana teina relationships. A positive and inclusive kindergarten culture promotes a strong sense belonging and wellbeing for children and their whānau.</p><p>Teachers effectively develop children’s confidence and competence as lifelong learners. Children are encouraged to be creative, use their imagination and problem solve. Teachers use intentional strategies to support children to revisit ideas, deepen understanding and develop social competencies. They have a deep understanding of <em>Te Whāriki</em> dispositions and learning outcomes. Through their interests and play children engage in high levels of sustained and complex learning.</p><p>The kindergarten curriculum is well designed and underpinned by the principles of <em>Te Whāriki</em> the early childhood curriculum. Literacy, mathematics and other curriculum areas are well planned for within carefully designed areas of play. Some te reo Māori is interwoven throughout the daily programme. Children learn through extra curriculum experiences provided by community people who participate in the weekly programme sharing their strengths with children and teachers. Children learn in meaningful and authentic contexts. Partnerships among teachers and families contributes positively to children's learning and wellbeing.</p><p>Assessment practices demonstrate children’s progress in a range of contexts and over time. Children's strengths are acknowledged and affirmed, and highlights their success in learning. Planning is responsive and informed by careful observation of children's interests and strengths. Children with additional learning needs receive individual education plans targeted specifically to support their wellbeing and learning. Children and their families often revisit individual assessment portfolios which provide a rich record of their achievement over time.</p><p>Governance and management have comprehensive, well-established systems and practices to enable the organisation to monitor, evaluate and plan for improvement for its early learning centres. Clear guidelines and expectations for centre practice and curriculum are strongly fostered by the leadership team and trust. The vision and values support positive outcomes for children’s learning, wellbeing and that of their whānau.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Continue deepening assessment, planning and evaluation practices to include a stronger focus on including Māori tamariki whakapapa, language, culture and identity in assessment practice.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Central Kids Kindergartens - Morrinsville completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Central Kids Kindergartens - Morrinsville will be in three years.</p><p>Phillip Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Central</p><p>14 February 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
