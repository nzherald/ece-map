</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Harold Mayo Kindergarten is an all day (six hours) kindergarten in central Hastings. It is located on the fringe of the central business district and serves a wide cross section of the Hastings community. Of the 42 children on the roll, 12 identify as Māori and six are Pacific. All teachers are qualified and registered.</p><p>The kindergarten philosophy focuses on providing a safe, happy and welcoming environment for children and their families and whānau. The commitment to work collaboratively to improve children’s learning outcomes is emphasised through the philosophy. Children’s sense of belonging is promoted and nurtured.</p><p>The kindergarten is governed by the Heretaunga Kindergarten Association (the association). Two Education Managers are employed by the association to provide professional support and guidance to teachers.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of eight kindergarten reviews in the Heretaunga Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children engage in a child-centred, play-based programme for sustained periods of time. The curriculum is exciting and challenging. Children are enthusiastic learners, guided and supported by teachers. The physical environment is well thought out. Teachers select natural resources that children can adapt for many purposes. Children are confident and happy and play cooperatively.</p><p>The kindergarten philosophy is clearly focused on making children’s learning experiences meaningful and is embedded in teaching practice. Teachers work collaboratively with families and respect their knowledge of their child as an integral part of the kindergarten’s learning community. Parents have many opportunities to contribute to overall operations and children’s learning. Families feel welcome and experience high levels of caring and respect from staff, who value and act on their suggestions and ideas.</p><p>Māori children and their families are valued and respected by teachers. Whānau aspirations for their children's success are promoted through formal and informal discussion. Teachers support the learning of Māori and Pacific children and engage confidently with their families. They work with other adults to ensure that children with diverse needs have equitable opportunities in the kindergarten through planned participation in the programme.</p><p>Children have many opportunities to develop literacy and mathematics knowledge in appropriate and authentic ways. Print and number are evident throughout the environment. Wall displays are vibrant and illustrate children’s involvement and learning in the programmes.</p><p>Effective teaching contributes to positive outcomes for all children. The ‘Virtues project’ was introduced in 2011 and has since been consolidated in the kindergarten culture. Children are supported to develop empathy and resilience. Teachers talk with children in ways that challenge their thinking. They include children in planning and setting up the learning environment. The atmosphere is relaxed and a sense of fun pervades.</p><p>Ongoing review of the impact of teaching on children’s learning is a feature of the kindergarten. Teachers use a wide range of information to make ongoing decisions about the programme and how they can continue to improve their teaching. Children are the focus for all reviews.</p><p>The Heretaunga Kindergarten Association provides guidance and support to teachers for the continuous improvement of teaching and learning. The recently developed strategic plan provides a clear long term direction for the association. Teachers are well supported through regular visits from the education managers who provide access to a wide range of professional learning opportunities.</p><p>There is a commitment by the association to increase teachers’ capabilities in te reo me ngā tikanga Māori through the introduction of the ‘Haere Whakamua’ project. This project is based around progressing the organisation’s journey in becoming bicultural.</p><p>The association identifies and ERO agrees that key areas for development include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>updating the appraisal process and policy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>providing clear expectations, through guiding documents, for programme delivery and kindergarten operations and monitoring their implementation.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>In addition, education managers should undertake strategic review and evaluation across the association to establish a deeper understanding of the ongoing professional learning needs of teachers. Information from review should be used to inform future decision making.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The association should:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>establish and review current guiding documents and monitor for successful implementation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>undertake strategic self review at association level.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Harold Mayo Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Harold Mayo Kindergarten will be in three years.<img title="" src="assets/index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" alt=""></p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region (Acting)</p><p>22 April 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
