</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Blossoms Educare Limited is a privately owned centre located close to Wiri Central School. The service provides full day education and care for up to 40 children including up to 10 under two years old. Both age groups are mixed during outdoor play but the children under two have a separate indoor space. Almost all the children on the roll are Māori or from Pacific backgrounds. Staff reflect the families’ cultural diversity.</p><p>The centre is one of six in the South Auckland area operated by the owner. The service focuses on increasing participation in early childhood education by providing an affordable service. Currently there is no cost to any child attending the Blossoms Wiri centre. Staff benefit from frequent visits by the support team (including the owner) who foster improvement in the quality of teaching and learning, help with resource development and monitor centre operations. This team is building the capacity of staff to operate the centre more independently, with centre specific procedures under the group’s policies and goals.</p><p>The owner, two support team leaders and six staff members are registered teachers. Centre staff have an external appraiser and mentor who supports their ongoing development and endorses their practising certificates. Teachers also participate in ongoing professional development focused on enhancing the quality of teaching and learning in the centre.</p><p>In 2013 ERO undertook a supplementary review of the service to follow up a range of concerns identified during the 2012 ERO visit. The leaders and teachers had made progress in most areas and were continuing to improve programmes for children under two, and their assessment and evaluation practices. ERO recommended improvements to policies, procedures and aspects of the environment. These areas continue to be a focus for development for the centre.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are happy and settled in the centre. They have positive relationships with teachers and many are developing friendships with their peers. Children engage well in prepared activities and make choices from a good variety of resources. Older children are developing social skills through cooperative group play and tuakana/teina relationships between children are evident. Children benefit from sustained periods of uninterrupted play and are learning to regulate their own snack and meal times.</p><p>Toddlers explore the environment independently and play happily alongside older children. Teachers take shared responsibility for them outdoors, but toddlers would benefit from more specific supervision and play experiences that are planned to match their individual developmental needs and interests.</p><p>Teachers support children to engage with resources. They interact warmly with children and some use questions well to encourage ideas and foster children's interests. Teachers could now strengthen their focus on deepening children's learning through their individual interests. Teachers regularly include cultural activities in the programme. They recognise the need to build on their bicultural practices, improve their confidence in te reo and tikanga Māori, and increase the visibility of te ao Māori in the environment.</p><p>Teachers continue to improve planning, assessment and evaluation. They regularly discuss their observations of children’s interests and plan resources and activities to support related topics. As part of their ongoing professional development, teachers should review how well their planning guides their teaching practices. It may be useful to develop a shared understanding of the characteristics of an effective teacher and help each other to achieve these skills. A greater focus on integrating curriculum areas such as literacy, numeracy and science in children’s play could help teachers to develop more complex learning experiences. This would also provide meaningful contexts for enriching children's conversations.</p><p>Parents who were interviewed appreciate the experiences their children enjoy at the centre and the positive relationships they have with staff. They value the multicultural environment and the events that are celebrated. They also value the communication they have with staff, and the extent to which the service is responsive to family needs. Parents notice that their children develop their oral language in the centre and are pleased that they are always keen to attend.</p><p>The owner provides sound leadership for staff. She provides an inclusive environment, regularly consulting teachers and involving them in decisions about strategic goals and the centre’s philosophy and vision. The owner strongly encourages professional development and has helped teachers to extend their understanding of self review. The relatively new head teacher is being supported to strengthen her leadership of the centre. Some changes in the organisation of staff could further unite the teaching team. Leaders agree they should continue to enhance their internal evaluation processes and intend to use ERO's early childhood indicators of best practice to identify improvement goals.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders agree that the key next steps for centre development should include:</p><ul>
<li>identifying and implementing strategies to further develop teachers’ ability to extend children's learning</li>
<li>continuing to develop rigorous programme planning and evaluation</li>
<li>ensuring that teachers’ appraisals match the documented procedures and that their goals are appropriately aligned with the Practising Teacher Criteria</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Blossoms Educare Limited completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve practices centre leaders should review and tighten the processes for monitoring health and safety systems.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Blossoms Educare Limited will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern</p><p>24 June 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
