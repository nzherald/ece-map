</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Tui Early Learners Nestlings/Fledglings, is one of three Tui Early Learner centres in Palmerston North. The licensee is an experienced early childhood educator and ensures resourcing supports her vision of providing high quality education and care.</p><p>In 2012, two licences were merged to form the current centre. It is licensed to cater for up to 80 children, including 15 up to two years old. In practice, Nestlings/Fledglings continues to operate as two separate areas, an up-to-three and over-three year old space. Although the two head teachers are relatively new to their role, they are well supported by managers and teachers.</p><p>The February 2011 ERO report identified the need to continue to develop self-review processes and strengthen partnerships with Māori whānau. Progress has been made.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Relationships between children, parents and teachers are respectful and responsive. A positive tone promotes constructive interactions and supports the learning of all children.</p><p>Children are happy, active learners. They enjoy the range of opportunities for physical play, exploration, literacy and numeracy development and socialisation. The centre is well equipped with resources that foster children’s curiosity.</p><p>A voluntary nature-explorers programme for four year olds links to the centre philosophy of the natural environment being an integral part of the curriculum. It successfully provides children the opportunity to learn and be challenged within a diverse rural setting.</p><p>Teachers encourage emerging interests and support child-led investigations. The programme provides experiences that allow children to revisit and consolidate their interests and learning. Adults are attentive and respond promptly to children’s requests. They play alongside them, extending language and thinking. Children are provided with feedback that acknowledges their effort and success.</p><p>Responsive and consistent care-giving within the centre supports infants and toddlers' need for strong and secure attachments. Teachers respond sensitively to each child’s changing needs and preferences. Routines are flexible and in tune with the needs and rhythms of children. A calm, slow pace is maintained and children have space and time to lead learning.</p><p>Partnerships are established with parents that positively support children’s learning. Families share information about their child that contributes to learning. Children’s involvement in the programme is celebrated and shared with parents.</p><p>Effective transition into and within the centre is a priority. Whānau teachers provide ongoing support for children as they move through the centre. Children’s sense of belonging is enhanced through positive interaction with caring adults who know them and their families well.</p><p>A culture is promoted in which children and their identities are valued, celebrated and affirmed as confident and capable learners. Leaders are knowledgeable about good early childhood education and care practice and use this to influence the programme and develop centre processes.</p><p>High expectations of staff are clearly articulated through induction, mentoring and professional learning. Evidence is effectively used to review processes and to reflect on the quality of teaching and learning. There is a strong focus on reflection and continual improvement. Managers very effectively support adults to provide good quality programmes for children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><ul>
<li>Teacher and leader inquiries identify best practice. Self review is systematic and evidence based. Furthering the extent to which reviews consider the quality of current programmes should support improved outcomes for children.</li>
<li>Development of the Nestlings external environment should consider ways to increase the extent to which the natural world is reflected.</li>
<li>Teachers focus on gaining a deeper view of children’s learning through assessment and planning. They should ensure assessment illustrates and supports continuity in learning and demonstrates children’s progress in a range of contexts.</li>
<li>Teachers are committed to increasing their bicultural understanding. They should use their developing competency to more fully integrate te reo me ngā tikanga Māori into the programme.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Tui Early Learners Nestlings/Fledglings completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p><p>The next ERO review of Tui Early Learners Nestlings/Fledglings will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region (Acting)</p><p>30 April 2014</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
