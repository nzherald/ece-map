<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Alicetown Playcentre is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children. Strong leadership, a well-organised approach to management and high levels of commitment from parents support sustained good practice and improvement.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>The playcentre is one of 18 administered by the Hutt Playcentre Association (the association). Bicultural partnership is integral to the way the association operates. An executive committee provides guidance and support for centre members. This includes leadership for strategic planning, financial management and policy development and for decisions related to the education programme, property and equipment. A kaitautoko, a centre support person employed by the association, visits and provides professional advice, feedback and role modelling to strengthen practice and promote improvement. The recently commenced review of the association&rsquo;s structure, supported by an external consultant, is aimed at improving operation and ensuring the sustainability of playcentres.</p><p>The centre runs five mixed-age sessions per week and two SPACE (Supporting Parents Alongside their Children's Education) sessions for parents and their infants and toddlers. Most are group supervised by members. Paid supervisors are employed when necessary. Rolls are full. A number of children attend until they reach primary school age.</p><p>The majority of centre members undertake playcentre training with high numbers attaining the course two (Te Puna) and three (Te Manga) certificates.</p><p>The playcentre was recently relicensed under the <em>Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008.</em> Significant refurbishment of the building was undertaken in preparation for licensing.</p><p>Alicetown Playcentre has a positive reporting history with ERO.</p><p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to reviews in eight early childhood education services within the Hutt Playcentre Association.</p><h3>Review Findings</h3><p>The philosophy, emphasising the values of free play and promotion of curiosity, creativity and involvement of parents in learning alongside their children, is well reflected in practice. Members&rsquo; inclusive and well considered approach provides good support for a diverse range of learning needs. All children are encouraged to investigate, explore, interact with others and have fun. Adults are responsive and follow children's leads, providing encouragement and resources to support and extend play. Sustained free play and creative self expression are encouraged. Aspects of literacy are appropriately integrated. Support for families making the transition to school is an area which would be timely to review and further develop. Plans to implement poroporoaki and the sharing of learning records have been discussed.</p><p>Children aged up-to-two years of age are considered competent learners. They are well supported through planning and as participants in daily sessions. Members actively promote opportunities for older children to care for and learn about younger ones.</p><p>The playcentre environment effectively supports children's independence and confidence as learners. Members maintain a wide variety of high quality resources and learning materials which are well organised and freely available to children. The outdoor area supports physically active play and adventurous activities. A positive and busy tone is evident. Children are cooperative and settled.</p><p>The association actively promotes bicultural partnership. A M&#257;ori perspective is embedded in the environment, protocols and programme. There is strong leadership and commitment to sustaining and continuing to improve members&rsquo; knowledge and understanding.</p><p>Centre members have a purposeful and flexible approach to planning the programme. Ideas are carefully considered to build on parents&rsquo; views about their own children's needs and the emerging interests of others attending daily sessions. Constructive review and development is undertaken by a planning team.</p><p>Members regularly observe, recount and record stories about individual children. Best examples of profile books are well presented and illustrate many aspects of children's participation and learning at playcentre. The daily team&rsquo;s in-depth discussions and sharing of information provide good support for decisions about further planning. All parents are encouraged to recognise learning linked to <em>Te&nbsp;Wh&#257;riki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and to participate in planning the programme.</p><p>Adults take pride in being part of a learning community alongside their children. A culture defined by strong, cooperative leadership, high expectations and support for each other fosters parents&rsquo; confidence and willingness to become involved in management roles and ongoing training. A variety of strategies is used to strengthen the induction process for new families. Many families retain membership until children move on to school. There is a strong sense of belonging and commitment to playcentre philosophy.</p><p>Members are reflective and improvement focused. Self review is valued and strongly promoted by the association. Good frameworks are in place to support practice at centre level.</p><p>The kaitautoko provides regular and valued feedback to support members in their roles. A more formalised approach focused on developing particular skills and knowledge should strengthen reflection on practice over time.</p><p>The association has a proactive approach to governance. It effectively works alongside members to support self management. This centre makes good use of association systems and processes to ensure legislative requirements are met, good practice is sustained and improvement is promoted.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Members agree that further development is needed to strengthen their approach to assessment, planning and evaluation. Particular attention should be given to:</p><ul>
<li>highlighting children's significant learning and adults' responses in portfolios</li>
<li>illustrating progressions of learning</li>
<li>enhancing children's ownership of their portfolios by making them more accessible</li>
<li>strengthening children's voices in the assessment process</li>
<li>continuing to strengthen understanding and implementation of evaluation.</li>
</ul><p>Members need to further develop their understanding and use of self review. Support to use some association frameworks more effectively, particularly those that build quality improvement, should strengthen their approach.</p><p>Seeking assistance to develop strategic plans is an agreed priority for development.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Alicetown Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region (Acting)</p><p>17 June 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><p>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
