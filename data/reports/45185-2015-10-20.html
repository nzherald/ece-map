</tr></tbody></table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Topkids Motutaiko is a purpose-built early childhood education and care service that opened in 2009, catering for children from three months to five years. It is located in central Taupō and the centre’s name originates from the island in the centre of Lake Taupō. At the time of this ERO review 78 children were enrolled, 38 of Māori descent, many of whom have whakapapa links to Ngāti Tūwharetoa.</p>
<p>The centre operates under the umbrella of BestStart Educare Limited (formerly Kidicorp Limited), which provides policy guidelines, strategic direction, financial and business management. Professional guidance and development for staff is provided by the BestStart area manager, who is highly effective in enhancing centre leadership and growing teachers’ capability to implement ‘best practice’. She also supports implementation of BestStart goals. These goals cover staffing, finances, curriculum, resource and premises, communication and consultation with parents and whānau.</p>
<p>The centre philosophy prioritises the value of relationships with children, parents, whānau and the local community. In addition, the goal is for children to become life-long learners. With this in mind, teachers aim to treat all children with aroha and focus on supporting foundation skills for full participation in the modern world.</p>
<p>ERO’s 2012 report identified next steps in relation to management roles, programme planning and aspects of the learning environment. The centre’s response to these areas has been significant and positive.</p>
<h3>The Review Findings</h3>
<p>Children benefit from a thoughtfully designed and well-implemented curriculum that effectively responds to their individual strengths, interests, languages, cultures and identities.</p>
<p>Through the centre’s holistic ‘be school ready’ approach, the teaching team demonstrates considerable expertise in fostering foundation skills for children's’ future learning. These include:</p>
<ul><li>social confidence, independence, self management and the ability to communicate ideas and feelings</li>
<li>early literacy, mathematics, science and technology through meaningful and ‘hands on’ learning</li>
<li>making choices, initiating and extending their learning through setting their own goals and challenges</li>
<li>creative expression, thinking, problem solving and researching questions about the world and how it works.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers make meaningful links with the community. They acknowledge Māori as tangata whenua and celebrate cultural diversity. As a result, children and families feel a strong sense of belonging and willingly contribute to the learning community.</p>
<p>Teachers implement highly effective practices for noticing, recognising and responding to children’s interests, learning, and parents’ aspirations. Written and digital portfolios are highly valued and clearly record the learning journey for each child. Through reciprocal partnerships with parents, teachers are well informed and plan and evaluate collaboratively to enhance learning outcomes for all children.</p>
<p>Highly respectful and responsive teaching and primary care practices contribute to the calm and nurturing centre environment where children’s wellbeing and belonging are promoted. Teachers understand the importance of babies and toddlers developing secure attachments with key adults, and work closely with families to align home and centre routines and practices. They trust all children as being capable learners and decision makers, implementing highly skilled teaching strategies to model and foster positive social skills and interactions.</p>
<p>Teachers are knowledgeable and reflective practitioners. They engage in focused professional learning and development that informs teaching approaches and curriculum development. Teachers work closely with children, supporting them to add complexity to play through thoughtful questioning, commenting and coaching. These interactions support children to sustain interests and engage in purposeful and meaningful learning and exploration.</p>
<p>Another positive feature of centre practice is support for children’s oral language development. Teachers have clear and shared expectations about appropriate levels of oral language. They work effectively with specialist services and parents to identify individual needs and support positive learning outcomes for children.</p>
<p>Highly effective leadership is contributing to focused self review and reflective practice. The area and centre managers collaborate with the teaching team to enhance practice and outcomes for children and families.</p>
<h3>Key Next Steps</h3>
<p>Centre leaders have identified and ERO agrees with the need to strengthen:</p>
<p>relationships and information sharing with local schools to bridge gaps in understanding of <em>Te Whāriki</em> and <em>The New Zealand Curriculum</em> in order to promote continuity of learning and positive transitions to school for children and families</p>
<p>the current model for growing teachers’ leadership opportunities within the team. This should more fully realise individuals’ potential to enhance positive outcomes for children.</p>
<h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3>
<p>Before the review, the staff and management of Topkids Motutaiko completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p>
<h3>Next ERO Review</h3>
<h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4>
<p>The next ERO review of Topkids Motutaiko will be in four years.</p>

<p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p>

<a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2>
<h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3>
<p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here:</a></p>
<p><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p>
<p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p>
<p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p>
<p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p>
<p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p>
<h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3>
<p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p>
<ul><li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p>
<h4>Review Coverage</h4>
<p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
