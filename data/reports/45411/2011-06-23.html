<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">Gloriavale Christian Community: Garden of Children 4 is one of four centres that operate within the Gloriavale Christian community complex. This centre caters for children generally aged from 6 to 18 months. Teachers are recently qualified early childhood teachers or teachers training to become early childhood teachers.</p><p align="left">At the time of the 2008 ERO review, Gloriavale Christian Community: Garden of Children 4 and Gloriavale Christian Community: Garden of Children 2 operated as one centre.</p><p align="left">The centre&rsquo;s Christian philosophy is well met in the warm, caring and responsive relationships that ERO observed among the children, the teachers and the families.</p><p align="left">Features of the programme include teachers:</p><ul>
<li>nurturing babies and toddlers so they have a sense of well-being and belonging</li>
<li>providing an inviting and well-resourced outdoor play area that has many opportunities for children to develop their physical skills</li>
<li>successfully integrating home values, beliefs and routines into the programme</li>
<li>responding to children&rsquo;s interest and including story reading, music and te reo M&#257;ori in the programme.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO observed some good teaching practice but also some variation in the quality of teaching. The managers and teachers have established an appropriate framework for self review, strategic planning and staff appraisal. They are now ready to make better use of this framework to improve the quality of teaching and the resulting learning outcomes for children. The managers and teachers should also extend their child assessment practices to more effectively identify and link the next steps for learning to planning and teaching practice.</p><p align="left">The Gloriavale centres have many examples of good management and teaching practice. The managers need to share this expertise more widely among the four centres to improve consistency in the quality of learning and teaching.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of Gloriavale Christian Community Garden of Children 4 was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children at Gloriavale Christian Community Garden of Children 4.</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">The centre philosophy is based on Christian principles and values. It recognises the importance of adults and children being polite, honest, respectful and having good manners. It aims to promote literacy and numeracy, inquiry, exploration of the natural world and the care of animals. Children are encouraged to develop their interests in music, arts and crafts. Tidiness, cleanliness and perseverance are valued attributes. The family is seen as central in this community.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><h5>Relationships</h5><p align="left">Babies and toddlers experience warm, caring and responsive relationships with their teachers. The teachers have created a happy, safe and stable environment. They enjoy being with the children. Most children appeared settled and contented.</p><p align="left">Teachers promote positive and nurturing relationships by:</p><ul>
<li>observing and responding promptly to children&rsquo;s needs and interests</li>
<li>sitting near children and showing an interest in their play</li>
<li>mirroring children&rsquo;s responses so that they learn to engage with other children in appropriate ways.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Teachers work cooperatively to meet children&rsquo;s needs and interests. They show delight in children&rsquo;s progress, value the suggestions of other teachers and support and encourage each other in their work with children.</p><h5>Well-being and belonging</h5><p align="left">Children benefit from continuity between the centre and the community environments. Teachers and families share the same values and use similar approaches to help children develop these values and characteristics.</p><p align="left">Families are actively involved in their children&rsquo;s care and education. Teachers make good use of the information that families share. They build on children&rsquo;s interests to promote their physical, social and emotional development. Children often visit their parents at work and this helps to strengthen the connections between the centre and community environments.</p><h5>The programme</h5><p align="left">The programme provides children with many opportunities to explore and find out about their world.</p><p align="left">The centre is well resourced in the indoor and outdoor areas. The outdoor environment is a feature. Children&rsquo;s physical development is encouraged by the good range of challenging climbing equipment provided in the outdoor area.</p><p align="left">Children&rsquo;s social skills are promoted by effective modelling. Some teachers were particularly successful in using this approach to help children share and include others. Some teachers make good use of children&rsquo;s interests to help them develop independence and self-help skills.</p><p align="left">Children&rsquo;s interest in literacy and music are promoted in the programme by teachers reading to children, singing songs and dancing with children. Some teachers provide extra resources to extend children&rsquo;s interest in these areas.</p><p align="left">Te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori are beginning to be integrated into the programme. Some teachers confidently use te reo M&#257;ori in their conversations and singing with the children.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><h5>Strengthening learning and teaching</h5><p align="left">ERO observed variation in the quality of teaching. The supervisor and teachers have an appropriate framework for self review, strategic planning, teacher appraisal and child assessment. They now need to:</p><ul>
<li>increase the focus on the quality of teaching in self review, strategic planning and staff appraisal to improve learning outcomes for children</li>
<li>make better use of child assessment information to identify the next steps for learning and more closely link this information to planning and teaching practice.</li>
</ul><h5>Sharing good practice</h5><p align="left">The Gloriavale centres are at the early stages of sharing examples of good management and teaching practices across all four centres. ERO agrees that this process needs to be extended further to improve consistency and shared understandings of good practice among the centres. This development should build capacity across the teams to improve the learning outcomes for all children.</p><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. National Evaluation Topic</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p align="left">ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long-term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h3>Partnerships with Wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori Children in Early Childhood Services</h3><p align="left">As part of this review, ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p><ul>
<li>this service understands and values the identity, language and culture of M&#257;ori children and their wh&#257;nau, particularly when the child and wh&#257;nau transition to the service</li>
<li>managers and educators have built relationships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children</li>
<li>this service works in partnership with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children.</li>
</ul><h4>Area of strength</h4><p align="left">Teachers have some knowledge of te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori that they use in the programme. They have expressed their commitment to furthering their knowledge and understanding of te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori. Teachers have sought information from parents about the aspirations of M&#257;ori wh&#257;nau. They are at early stages of analysing the information gathered. They have begun to seek support from the M&#257;ori families in their community and local M&#257;ori in the wider local community.</p><h4>Area for development and review</h4><p align="left">The teachers have identified, and ERO agrees, that the next step for teachers is to continue building their knowledge and understanding of te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori in their centre. This includes ways to integrate this knowledge and understanding of bicultural practices in the centre programme.</p><a id="4-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Gloriavale Christian Community Garden of Children 4 completed an ERO Centre Management Assurance Statement andSelf-Audit Checklist. In these documents they have attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><p align="left">administration</p><ul>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>

</table><p>&nbsp;</p><p>23 June 2011</p><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-gloriavale-christian-community-garden-of-children-4" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Gloriavale Christian Community Garden of Children 4</h2><p align="left">These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Gloriavale Christian Community Garden of Children 4.</p><p align="left">Gloriavale Christian Community: Garden of Children 4 is one of four centres that operate within the Gloriavale Christian community complex. This centre caters for children generally aged from 6 to 18 months. Teachers are recently qualified early childhood teachers or teachers training to become early childhood teachers.</p><p align="left">At the time of the 2008 ERO review, Gloriavale Christian Community: Garden of Children 4 and Gloriavale Christian Community: Garden of Children 2 operated as one centre.</p><p align="left">The centre&rsquo;s Christian philosophy is well met in the warm, caring and responsive relationships that ERO observed among the children, the teachers and the families.</p><p align="left">Features of the programme include teachers:</p><ul>
<li>nurturing babies and toddlers so they have a sense of well-being and belonging</li>
<li>providing an inviting and well-resourced outdoor play area that has many opportunities for children to develop their physical skills</li>
<li>successfully integrating home values, beliefs and routines into the programme</li>
<li>responding to children&rsquo;s interest and including story reading, music and te reo M&#257;ori in the programme.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO observed some good teaching practice but also some variation in the quality of teaching. The managers and teachers have established an appropriate framework for self review, strategic planning and staff appraisal. They are now ready to make better use of this framework to improve the quality of teaching and the resulting learning outcomes for children. The managers and teachers should also extend their child assessment practices to more effectively identify and link the next steps for learning to planning and teaching practice.</p><p align="left">The Gloriavale centres have many examples of good management and teaching practice. The managers need to share this expertise more widely among the four centres to improve consistency in the quality of learning and teaching.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again three years.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p align="left">If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p align="left">&nbsp;Graham Randell</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Southern Region</p><a id="general-information-about-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h2><h3>About ERO</h3><p align="left">ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h3>About ERO Reviews</h3><p align="left">ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p align="left">Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h3>Review Focus</h3><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><b>Quality of Education</b> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><b>Additional Review Priorities</b> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><b>National Evaluation Topics</b> &ndash; This strand contributes to the development of education policies and their effective implementation. The information from this strand is aggregated by ERO for its national evaluation reports. Topics for investigation are changed regularly to provide up-to-date information.</li>
<li><b>Compliance with Legal Requirements</b> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p align="left">ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h3>Review Recommendations</h3><p align="left">Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
