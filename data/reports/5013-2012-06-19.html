<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">Mairtown Free Kindergarten in Whangarei provides high quality early childhood education and care for children. Teachers have a shared philosophy and vision that is reflected in their clear curriculum priorities for children&rsquo;s learning. Te Wh&#257;riki, the early childhood curriculum guidelines, underpins a programme that features children learning through play and nature-based experiences and environments. Teachers and children work together to plan for learning.</p><p align="left">Children learn to regard themselves as competent and capable. The programme fosters children&rsquo;s creativity and early literacy, mathematics and science learning are integrated across the curriculum. Children care for each other and confidently use social skills to maintain positive friendships.</p><p align="left">Teachers support children well, encouraging them to initiate their own learning. They maximise conversations with children to extend their thoughts and ideas. Teachers provide real resources and equipment that children treat with care. Teachers&rsquo; careful preparation of play areas reflects curriculum priorities and the value placed on aesthetics and uncluttered play spaces.</p><p align="left">Respectful, reciprocal relationships with families and wh&#257;nau, and the community promote a sense of belonging and inclusion. A wide variety of processes are in place to share information with the kindergarten community about learning and the programme. Teachers&rsquo; commitment to bicultural practices is very evident.</p><p align="left">Teachers are skilled professionals who work collaboratively and are highly reflective. They have established self-review practices that focus on ongoing improvement. The kindergarten operates under the auspices of the Northland Kindergarten Association that provides good systems and support for the kindergarten.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of Mairtown Free Kindergarten was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children at Mairtown Free Kindergarten.</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children</li>
<li>the learning environment</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p align="left">ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">There have been significant changes at Mairtown Free Kindergarten since ERO&rsquo;s review in 2009. New members have joined the teaching team, the physical environment has been extensively upgraded and operational hours changed in 2011 to a kindergarten day model.</p><p align="left">Although the head teacher was new to the kindergarten in 2009, ERO reported that good leadership was resulting in the development of a highly functioning and collaborative teaching team. The kindergarten continues to be very well led, with teachers using purposeful self review to enhance the curriculum.</p><p align="left">With the support of an Association scholarship in 2011, teachers have established a weekly Friday programme where a group of older children, a teacher and parent helpers spend the session in a local park with native bush. The aim of this programme is to promote children&rsquo;s understanding, care and respect for New Zealand&rsquo;s natural environment. Teachers&rsquo; ongoing review and parent feedback is identifying many positive outcomes for children from this session.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p align="left"><strong>Curriculum design and enactment.</strong> Teachers provide a high quality programme where their curriculum priorities, practice and the kindergarten philosophy are clearly aligned. Input and feedback from families informs teachers&rsquo; ongoing review about curriculum design and direction.</p><p align="left"><strong>Children&rsquo;s learning.</strong> Children engage for long periods in collaborative play and exploration. They are well supported by teachers to take responsibility for themselves and make decisions about their learning. Teachers&rsquo; high quality assessment clearly describes children&rsquo;s learning over time. Their assessment of Maori children&rsquo;s learning sensitively describes a growing sense of self and pride in being M&#257;ori. Assessment portfolios are valued by children and wh&#257;nau and their ongoing contribution to these records is evident.</p><p align="left"><strong>High quality teaching practice.</strong> Teachers promote play-based learning based on children&rsquo;s new and ongoing interests. Children&rsquo;s ideas and choices determine the direction of the daily programme. Teachers&rsquo; skilfully use conversations with children to help them successfully initiate and accomplish their plans.</p><p align="left"><strong>Commitment to bicultural practice.</strong> Teachers continue to develop practices and procedures that reflect their commitment to providing a bicultural curriculum. They make good use of te reo M&#257;ori in kindergarten documents and in their conversations. Resources and the programme reflect both traditional and contemporary M&#257;ori themes. With the support of the Association and wh&#257;nau M&#257;ori, teachers, children and families are growing in understanding of tikanga M&#257;ori and the significance of the local area for M&#257;ori.</p><p align="left"><strong>Kindergarten environment.</strong> The physical environment is well planned to support children&rsquo;s learning. Teachers&rsquo; careful preparation of play areas reflects curriculum priorities and the value placed on aesthetics and uncluttered play spaces. Natural and open-ended resources throughout the kindergarten are used in imaginative and creative ways by children.</p><p align="left"><strong>Self review.</strong> Successful self review focuses on positive improvement to the quality of children&rsquo;s care and education. Teachers work collaboratively on review planning and implementation and ensure that reviews are well informed by current research and theory of best early childhood practice.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p align="left">ERO agrees with teachers that focus areas for kindergarten development could include:</p><ul>
<li>ongoing curriculum development that includes a documented description of all the elements of the kindergarten curriculum to use for staff induction and for the transition of children and families into the service</li>
<li>embedding a process of individual teacher reflection</li>
<li>continuing to deepen teachers&rsquo; knowledge to support development of the bicultural curriculum.</li>
</ul><a id="3-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Mairtown Free Kindergarten completed an ERO Centre Management Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse)</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>

Teachers have a shared philosophy and vision that is reflected in their clear curriculum priorities for children&rsquo;s learning. Te Wh&#257;riki, the early childhood curriculum guidelines, underpins a programme that features children learning through play and nature-based experiences and environments. Teachers and children work together to plan for learning.</p><p align="left">Children learn to regard themselves as competent and capable. The programme fosters children&rsquo;s creativity and early literacy, mathematics and science learning are integrated across the curriculum. Children care for each other and confidently use social skills to maintain positive friendships.</p><p align="left">Teachers support children well, encouraging them to initiate their own learning. They maximise conversations with children to extend their thoughts and ideas. Teachers provide real resources and equipment that children treat with care. Teachers&rsquo; careful preparation of play areas reflects curriculum priorities and the value placed on aesthetics and uncluttered play spaces.</p><p align="left">Respectful, reciprocal relationships with families and wh&#257;nau, and the community promote a sense of belonging and inclusion. A wide variety of processes are in place to share information with the kindergarten community about learning and the programme. Teachers&rsquo; commitment to bicultural practices is very evident.</p><p align="left">Teachers are skilled professionals who work collaboratively and are highly reflective. They have established self-review practices that focus on ongoing improvement. The kindergarten operates under the auspices of the Northland Kindergarten Association that provides good systems and support for the kindergarten.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is likely to review the centre again in three years.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p align="left">If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.&nbsp;</p><p align="left">Makere Smith</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Northern Region (Acting)</p></html>
