</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>BestStart Kaikohe is licensed to provide full-day education and care for 50 children, including up to 16 aged under two years. Children are cared for in two age-related groups. Infants and toddlers have their own separate indoor and outdoor play spaces. After children turn two, as teachers and families recognise they are ready, they transition to the area for older children. Enrolled children are mainly from Māori and Pākehā cultural backgrounds.</p><p>The centre is led by a manager and two head teachers. The head teacher appointments have been made since the 2015 ERO report. Three other qualified teachers, and a teacher in training complete the newly established teaching team.</p><p>The philosophy of the service is strongly underpinned by a commitment to embrace bicultural and multicultural ways of working, and to strengthening teacher practice. Teachers and leaders value partnerships with parents, and aim to provide a programme that reflects the identity of each child.</p><p>The centre's past three ERO reports have acknowledged as strengths, the centre's commitment to biculturalism and partnerships with parents. The 2015 ERO report also highlighted sensitive and responsive teaching practices which supported children to engage in the programme and lead their own learning. These positive aspects have been maintained.</p><p>Agreed areas for ongoing development from the 2015 ERO report included strengthening self review, further developing teaching practice to support children's critical thinking, and an evaluation of the curriculum. There has been good progress in these areas.</p><p>The centre is one of the BestStart Education and Care Centres. The BestStart organisation provides an overarching governance and management framework as well as personnel to support the operation and curriculum development in individual centres.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of three centre reviews in the BestStart organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Teachers provide attractively presented, calm environments that support children's learning across a wide range of curriculum areas. Their sensitive and respectful interactions support children to develop a sense of wellbeing and belonging in the centre environment. Teachers use effective strategies to promote children's developing social competence.</p><p>Children settle quickly into their day. They engage meaningfully with the environment as they easily access resources and equipment for their play. Their enjoyment is evident as they choose to play imaginatively with friends, or explore on their own.</p><p>Teachers interact respectfully with infants and toddlers. They are responsive to children's individual temperaments, preferences and interests. Teachers engage well with whānau to learn more about each child. They allow these young children time and space to explore their own learning.</p><p>Partnerships with families are well established through ongoing conversations. Shared information is included in children's individual development plans. Transitions through the centre are child led with the support of teachers and whānau.</p><p>Te ao Māori is visible in the centre. The carved pou at the entrance to the building represent knowledge and learning, old and new, and connect the past to the present. Te reo Māori is extensively and meaningfully used in centre displays and documentation. Teachers and leaders are considering how to introduce more te reo Māori in their interactions with children.</p><p>Teachers know children well as learners. They plan programmes that are strongly linked to <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and inclusive of parent aspirations. The process could be strengthened through ongoing evaluation of outcomes for children as a result of teachers' planned responses. Programme planning is aligned to the centre's strategic plan.</p><p>Leaders clearly articulate their vision and goals for the direction of the centre. There is compelling evidence that reflective thinking leads to improved outcomes for children. The newly established teaching team is challenging earlier practices and trialling new ways of working. As a result, teachers are developing shared understandings of what a good quality programme looks like in their context.</p><p>Centre operations are guided by a strategic plan and a shared vision. These are linked to the recently developed strategic goals of the BestStart organisation. This good practice promotes teachers' recognition that they belong to a wider learning community and supports collaboration amongst teaching teams. Leaders and teachers regularly review progress towards centre's strategic and annual plans. They monitor the quality of the centre operations and promote ongoing improvement.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders agree their key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>refining the centre philosophy as the team culture grows</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to develop programme planning processes, including ongoing, timely programme evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>establishing consistency in the quality of teachers' learning conversations with children, in order to provoke children's curiosity and develop their critical thinking.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of BestStart Kaikohe completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of BestStart Kaikohe will be in three years.</p><p>Julie Foley</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>14 August 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
