<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p>Toru Fet&#363; Kindergarten is the first purpose-built Pacific kindergarten in New Zealand. It operates as a single kindergarten using 3 teaching rooms under two licences. The Cook Island, Tuvalu and Niue cultures are nurtured separately within the scope of one Pacific kindergarten. Toru Fet&#363; 1 and 2 share some common play spaces and a community room.</p><p>Toru Fet&#363; 1 Kindergarten (known as Te Punanga Reo Kuki Airani) began as one of three culture-based playgroups, now under the umbrella management of Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The association is responsive to the cultural integrity and aspirations of each group. The teaching teams are led by a head teacher and two assistant head teachers, with support of an association senior teacher and a pacific coordinator.</p><p>Children and fanau/wh&#257;nau are welcomed warmly to the kindergarten. Children greet teachers with enthusiasm and are settled in their play. Interactions between teachers and children are nurturing, respectful and attuned to the individual needs of children.</p><p>Teachers respond to children&rsquo;s questions and join in the fun of learning and exploring. Routines around devotion and kai times show a balance between free play and cultural protocols. Pacific language is integrated well into the programme and conversations between children can be in multiple languages.</p><p>The programme is responsive, interactive and flexible, and based on children&rsquo;s observed interests. It reflects a shared understanding of what is valued across the diverse cultures and integrates well with the stated aims and philosophy of the kindergarten. Teachers support each other in the production of learning stories which are multi-voice and in multiple languages. It should enhance the stories if teachers identify possible opportunities to extend learning and provide challenge.</p><p>Staff are committed to supporting opportunities for parents to participate in their child&rsquo;s acquisition of different Pacific languages. Raising the profile of early childhood education in the community is the basis for encouraging increasing numbers of parents to be involved as educators.</p><p>The well-considered design of the facility allows children free access to multiple play areas, with easy flow between rooms. Each room uniquely reflects its cultural heritage supporting a sense of identity. The mixed-age groups facilitate the fostering of empathy with others. Learning occurs in a very inclusive climate.</p><p>It is to the credit of the core holders of the cultures, the association and the Ministry of Education that this unique venture is now in a position to go forward with confidence. The systems and structures now in place, along with ongoing development of robust self review, augur well for continuing improvement at the kindergarten.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Toru Fet&#363; 1 Kindergarten was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p>The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children atToru Fet&#363; 1 Kindergarten.</p><p>All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><p>In addition, ERO decided to evaluate:</p><ul>
<li>association support</li>
</ul><p>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below.</p><h3>The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p>The founding members of the playgroups worked cooperatively to create a Pacific early childhood community which is culturally inclusive, maintains strong community relationships, and fosters a sense of place in the community. Sufficient time was given to fully consult with the three cultures involved to form an overall vision, philosophy and facility design.</p><p>Association personnel provide support for systems and procedures, opportunities for professional development and leadership, strategic placement of staff, and induction and mentoring for provisionally registered teachers. The association is responsive to the cultural aspirations of each group.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><h5>Programme, planning and assessment</h5><p>The programme is responsive, interactive and flexible. It reflects a shared understanding of what is valued across the diverse cultures and integrates well with the stated aims and philosophy of the kindergarten.</p><p>Teachers are responsive to children&rsquo;s questions and join in the fun of learning and exploring alongside the children. Routines around devotion and kai times show a balance between free play and cultural protocols. The programme encourages involvement of parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><p>Planning, based on observed children&rsquo;s interests, is clearly documented and well-displayed to inform staff and fanau/wh&#257;nau. Cooperative fortnightly planning meetings involve team and individual teacher planning, with consistent practice across the three rooms. Staff and children are proud to belong to the first Pacific early childhood centre to be awarded a bronze Healthy Heart Award.</p><p>Pacific language is integrated well into the programme, as are basic maths concepts. Conversations between children can be in multiple languages. Regular visits to the adjacent school and the local public library demonstrate the importance given to early literacy. A group of older children from all three rooms come together daily for extension activities. This provides opportunities to socialise and acquire skills which facilitate transition to school.</p><p>Children&rsquo;s learning and progress is captured in attractive individual profile books, along with sharing at parent-teacher meetings. A full audit and evaluation of profile books across all rooms resulted in changes made to improve quality and consistency. Teachers support each other in the production of learning stories which are multi-voice and in multiple languages. There are many stories where teachers have identified leadership in their cultures and noted children&rsquo;s conversations, including comments on their own learning experiences. It would be beneficial to identify further possible opportunities for extending children&rsquo;s learning and providing challenge.</p><h5>Environment</h5><p>The well-considered design of the facility allows children free access to multiple play areas, with easy flow between rooms. Each room uniquely reflects its cultural heritage which supports a sense of identity. The mixed-age groups facilitate the fostering of empathy with others. Learning occurs in a very inclusive climate.</p><p>Educators, finding a paucity of appropriate resources in the various languages, are beginning to produce their own. Avenues being explored include a parent handbook, traditional stories and songs, and translations of children&rsquo;s favourite stories.</p><h5>Interactions</h5><p>Children and fanau/wh&#257;nau are warmly welcomed to the kindergarten. Children greet teachers with enthusiasm and are settled in their play. Interactions between teachers and children are nurturing, respectful and attuned to the individual needs of children. Teachers model positive guidance strategies when conflict arises. They operate in a high trust climate where they are encouraged and supported to reflect on each other&rsquo;s practice.</p><h5>Fanau/Wh&#257;nau and community relationships</h5><p>Strong reciprocal community relationships are well-established. Good use is made of the Community Room for parent and community gatherings. Staff are committed to supporting opportunities for parents to participate in their child&rsquo;s acquisition of different pacific languages.</p><h5>Leadership</h5><p>A devolved model helps develop leadership capacity. Each staff member has a voice in decision-making. Raising the profile of early childhood education in the community is the basis for encouraging increasing numbers of parents to be involved as educators.</p><h5>Self review</h5><p>Formal and informal review is occurring. Planned review using supplied templates has begun. This is an area for ongoing development.</p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p>The following apply to all three rooms.</p><ul>
<li>Self review is an area for ongoing development. This is stated in the strategic plan of the association.</li>
<li>The purpose of the learning enrichment group is currently under review. ERO&rsquo;s external evaluation confirms the review is timely, to ensure objectives align with current research.</li>
<li>Learning stories could be enhanced by identifying possible opportunities for further extending learning and providing suitable challenge.</li>
<li>Continuing to focus on widening teaching strategies, especially questioning techniques which foster thinking skills and problem solving, will improve learning outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><h3>Association Support</h3><h4>Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association</h4><p>Toru Fet&#363; 1 is affiliated to the Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The association has a governing board and a general manager. The general manager is the licensed service provider contact person for the kindergarten. The association employs a team of senior teachers, one of whom is responsible for leading the professional support and advice and guidance to the teaching team. She also liaises with the kindergarten community.</p><h4>Background</h4><p>The 2008 ERO review of the association identified several strengths, including the provision of professional development, sound operation plans, support for property development and the use of a range of communication strategies to keep teachers and communities informed. Areas for improvement included the quality and depth of the written feedback given to teachers by the senior teacher and strengthening the appraisal process.</p><p>Since 2008, the association has led consultation with the community to modify session times and improve the ratio of teachers to children from 1:15 to 1:10 and maintained its policy of employing qualified, registered teachers in regulated permanent positions.</p><p>The association provides expectations and guidance to the kindergarten through its strategic plan, policies and procedures and more recently, the professional development strategy Te Manawa: Criteria for Curriculum Implementation.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p>The association continues to provide high levels of guidance and support to teachers for the continuous improvement of teaching and learning. These include:</p><ul>
<li>the strategic plan setting expectations for participation, parent/wh&#257;nau involvement and quality teaching practices</li>
<li>clearly defined indicators of quality teaching and learning practice through Te&nbsp;Manawa</li>
<li>a wide range of professional development opportunities, including well considered support and guidance for provisionally registered teachers</li>
<li>ongoing support in property development, human resource management, finance and resourcing.</li>
</ul><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p>The association, senior teachers and ERO have identified areas where the association can strengthen their support for teachers. These include:</p><ul>

</table><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-toru-fetu-1-kindergarten" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Toru Fet&#363; 1 Kindergarten</h2><p>These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Toru Fet&#363; 1 Kindergarten.</p><p>Toru Fet&#363; Kindergarten is the first purpose-built Pacific kindergarten in New Zealand. It operates as a single kindergarten using 3 teaching rooms under two licences. The Cook Island, Tuvalu and Niue cultures are nurtured separately within the scope of one Pacific kindergarten. Toru Fet&#363; 1 and 2 share some common play spaces and a community room.</p><p>Toru Fet&#363; 1 Kindergarten (known as Te Punanga Reo Kuki Airani) began as one of three culture-based playgroups, now under the umbrella management of Wellington Region Free Kindergarten Association (the association). The association is responsive to the cultural integrity and aspirations of each group. The teaching teams are led by a head teacher and two assistant head teachers, with support of an association senior teacher and a pacific coordinator.</p><p>Children and fanau/wh&#257;nau are welcomed warmly to the kindergarten. Children greet teachers with enthusiasm and are settled in their play. Interactions between teachers and children are nurturing, respectful and attuned to the individual needs of children.</p><p>Teachers respond to children&rsquo;s questions and join in the fun of learning and exploring. Routines around devotion and kai times show a balance between free play and cultural protocols. Pacific language is integrated well into the programme and conversations between children can be in multiple languages.</p><p>The programme is responsive, interactive and flexible, and based on children&rsquo;s observed interests. It reflects a shared understanding of what is valued across the diverse cultures and integrates well with the stated aims and philosophy of the kindergarten. Teachers support each other in the production of learning stories which are multi-voice and in multiple languages. It should enhance the stories if teachers identify possible opportunities to extend learning and provide challenge.</p><p>Staff are committed to supporting opportunities for parents to participate in their child&rsquo;s acquisition of different Pacific languages. Raising the profile of early childhood education in the community is the basis for encouraging increasing numbers of parents to be involved as educators.</p><p>The well-considered design of the facility allows children free access to multiple play areas, with easy flow between rooms. Each room uniquely reflects its cultural heritage supporting a sense of identity. The mixed-age groups facilitate the fostering of empathy with others. Learning occurs in a very inclusive climate.</p><p>It is to the credit of the core holders of the cultures, the association and the Ministry of Education that this unique venture is now in a position to go forward with confidence. The systems and structures now in place, along with ongoing development of robust self review, augur well for continuing improvement at the kindergarten.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p>ERO is likely to review the service again in three years.</p><p>When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.</p><p>If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Central Region (Acting)</p><h3>GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVIEWS</h3><h4>About ERO</h4><p>ERO is an independent, external evaluation agency that undertakes reviews of schools and early childhood services throughout New Zealand.</p><h4>About ERO Reviews</h4><p>ERO follows a set of standard procedures to conduct reviews. The purpose of each review is to:</p><ul>
<li>improve quality of education for children in early childhood centres; and</li>
<li>provide information to parents, communities and the Government.</li>
</ul><p>Reviews are intended to focus on outcomes for children and build on each centre&rsquo;s self review.</p><h4>Review Focus</h4><p>ERO&rsquo;s framework for reviewing and reporting is based on four review strands.</p><ul>
<li><strong>Quality of Education</strong> &ndash; including the quality of the programme provided for children, the quality of the learning environment and the quality of the interactions between staff and children and how these impact on outcomes for children.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Review Priorities</strong> &ndash; other aspects of the operation of a centre, may be included in the review. ERO will not include this strand in all reviews.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance with Legal Requirements</strong> &ndash; assurance that this centre has taken all reasonable steps to meet legal requirements.</li>
</ul><h4>Review Coverage</h4><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of centre performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to this centre.</p><h4>Review Recommendations</h4><p>Most ERO reports include recommendations for improvement. A recommendation on a particular issue does not necessarily mean that a centre is performing poorly in relation to that issue. There is no direct link between the number of recommendations in this report and the overall performance of this centre.</p></html>
