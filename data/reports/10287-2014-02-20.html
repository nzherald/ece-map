</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>KiNZ Myers Park is a mixed aged centre licensed for 50 children, including up to 10 children under two years of age. The centre provides an all day education and care service. Children are grouped in two large rooms according to their age.</p><p>The centre is located in the Auckland central business district and reflects the wide diversity of families living in central Auckland as well as those who work in the city but live in outlying suburbs. The city based families are usually new migrants, parents coming to New Zealand to study, and those who have chosen to live and work in the city. The centre provides well for the children of these families.</p><p>The centre is part of the Kindergarten NZ Limited (KiNZ) Early Learning Centres, which is a subsidiary of the Auckland Kindergarten Association. A sound governance and management base of professional policies, procedures and operating systems is in place. Active support from KiNZ personnel informs and supports ongoing service improvement. Performance management processes and opportunities for professional learning and development evolve from extensive self review. Day to day management is delegated to the centre manager. Most teachers are qualified, registered and experienced. Two teachers have early intervention training and are able to provide specialist support for children with special needs. KiNZ Myers Park caters for an ethnically diverse community.</p><p>The 2011 ERO report noted the skilled leadership of the centre and the manager’s well considered change management. ERO also affirmed good processes for self review to guide purposeful and appropriate centre development. Children were well cared for and sensitively supported to make independent choices about their play. These good practices have been sustained and contribute to an effective learning environment. ERO recommended that managers continue to use to use self review to identify, prioritise and strategically manage centre development. Centre managers have responded well to this recommendation and have made good progress in the use of self review.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre manager is a strategic, capable professional leader. She works inclusively with a professional team who have a strong commitment to achieving positive outcomes for all children. In accordance with the centre philosophy, staff work to ensure that the well-being and education of every child is at the heart of centre practices. They focus on empowering children to make their own choices, experiment, discover and build friendships through the learning programme.</p><p>Children and whānau are warmly welcomed into the centre. Respectful relationships and care are significant features of the centre culture. All infants, toddlers and preschoolers benefit from a primary caregiver system that provides high quality individual care and attention. The primary caregiver approach provides a point of contact and continuity for parents/whānau and helps build children’s sense of belonging and security.</p><p>Children play and learn together in creative and imaginative ways. They are well supported by teachers to lead their own learning. They enjoy uninterrupted opportunities to investigate and explore their surroundings. Teachers’ calm and gentle interactions support a programme that is unhurried and responsive to children’s preferences. Children with special abilities and needs are well supported.</p><p>The attractive centre environment promotes children’s engagement in the programme and invites and provokes their imaginative play. Children have appropriate spaces to work and play quietly. Extensive outdoor play spaces provide space for physical activity and opportunities for children to enjoy challenge.</p><p>Children’s assessment portfolios provide records of their learning and include parent contributions. Children’s language, culture and identity are acknowledged and respected. During 2013, teachers supported children by responding to repeated patterns or actions in their play. These high quality interactions are reflected in planning and learning stories. Improvements in teachers’ thinking and practice have led to a better understanding of each individual child, and a greater focus on children’s physical and emotional wellbeing and relationships with parents.</p><p>Reflection and self review are an intrinsic part of teachers’ professional practice. Teachers are encouraged and supported to take leadership roles in the centre. They are committed to ongoing and whole centre professional learning, which they use to improve their practice and outcomes for children.</p><p>Strategic and annual plans have an explicit focus on innovative and responsive leadership developed from effective self review and teachers’ reflections on their professional practice. The centre is involved with The University of Auckland in professional learning and development and a range of research projects. The centre manager is working with early childhood professionals from centres to share the outcomes of these projects and professional learning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The centre’s ongoing self review, performance management and teacher inquiries have identified next steps for centre development. ERO affirms centre leaders’ and teachers’ plans to continue to:</p><ul>
<li>build on their knowledge of bicultural practices</li>
<li>extend transition to school processes by developing relationships with local schools</li>
<li>develop better understandings of families’ cultural backgrounds so that stronger partnerships support children’s learning.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of KiNZ Myers Park completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of KiNZ Myers Park will be in four years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>20 February 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
