</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Abbey’s Place is a privately owned education and care service located in the Tauranga suburb of Brookfield. The service is licensed for 47 children including a maximum of 10 aged under two years. At the time of this ERO review 51 children were enrolled, 22 of whom identify as Māori. The centre operates an area for babies and toddlers, and a separate area for children aged two and over. The service is open from 7.30 am to 5.30 pm Monday to Friday.</p><p>The centre philosophy documents the commitment to respecting the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi and providing a programme that realises the potential of Māori children. Staff have a commitment to bicultural practices and te reo Māori is promoted and integrated in the centre. Leaders and teachers believe that the feeling of belonging that this centre provides, contributes to children’s well-being, security and sense of identity. In addition, they believe whānau of all tamariki should feel that they belong and are able to participate in the programme.</p><p>Since the last ERO review, the owner has retired, and directors have been appointed to oversee the governance of the service. The directors work closely with the centre manager who returned to the role in 2013. Two of the nine teaching staff are long serving, seven have a recognised early childhood teaching qualification, and two are in training. The centre has responded positively to the areas identified for development in the previous 2012 ERO report and in particular, the area for self review focused on improving outcomes for children. Other areas identified are still ongoing priorities for the centre, including the need for centre owners to provide teachers with professional development in planning and assessing children’s learning.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre manager and staff warmly welcome all children and their whānau. They have established positive, respectful and reciprocal relationships with parents and whānau. Children’s sense of identity, language and culture are fostered through the effective integration of te reo Māori and aspects of tikanga. They are encouraged as kaiawhina, to learn their pepeha, learn about the local mythology of the area, and recite their whakapapa. Teachers knowledge of waiata, haka, pūrakau, pakieaitaitara, karakia, and whānau helps them extend children’s thinking and foster new understandings.</p><p>Teachers’ interactions with children are focused on care and building children’s self-management skills. ERO observed children engaged in sustained play in a calm, settled environment. Interactions among teachers and children are sensitive, appropriate and responsive to children’s well being. Teachers work to provide inclusive education and care for children with special needs. Children’s transitions within the service and on to school are well managed and include regular visits to the neighbouring school.</p><p>The learning programme is underpinned by the goals of <em>Te Whāriki</em> (the early childhood curriculum). Teachers plan the environment and learning activities to invite children’s participation in a range of experiences. Literacy and numeracy skills are effectively integrated into children’s play. ERO observed older children enjoying mathematical learning activites in which their individual levels of knowledge and skills were extended in group and individual contexts. Teachers frequently share books with children to foster a love of reading.</p><p>Recent centre self review has resulted in considerable improvements to the indoor learning environments. These areas feature displays that celebrate children’s learning and create a sense of belonging. Many of the displays in the centre reinforce the bicultural nature of Aotearoa/New Zealand. These displays include a range of natural materials and resources of cultural significance that reflect the background of children and whānau. Aspects of the outdoor environment in both areas continue to present challenges that compromise the quality of education and care. ERO and centre leaders agree, that this is an area that requires urgent attention.</p><p>The new directors and centre manager have made good use of external mentors provided by a Ministry of Education initiative to develop a useful framework for strategic and annual planning that guides centre development. These mentors have also assisted with valuable professional development about effective self review, and provided constructive feedback on ways to enhance aspects of the environment, learning programme and teaching practice. Teachers have also benefitted from recent professional development, are increasingly engaging in professional dialogue, and are adopting a collaborative approach to teaching and learning. This is contributing to a growing atmosphere of collegiality and progress.</p><p>Features of this service are high levels of relational trust that are evident between leaders and whānau, and the way bicultural partnerships are integral to these relationships. Te reo Māori courses for parents have been run at the centre and parents interviewed by ERO were highly supportive of the staff and the community spirit fostered by the service. Leaders and teachers are able to refer parents to the nearby community centre that provides a range of programmes to support educational opportunities for whānau. The centre has established a good partnership with whānau, hapu and iwi and have links with local mārae. However, an important next step is to explore ways to involve parents in discussions about aspirations for their children and reviewing aspects of the service.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO, the manager and centre director agree that the following developments are necessary to strengthen the quality of service provided:</p><ul>
<li>Review the way that teachers plan the centre programme to ensure it is consistent with the stated philosophy ‘to provide an emergent curriculum that expands on children’s strengths and interests’.</li>
<li>Teachers in the infants and toddlers area need to more consistently promote children’s independence and problem solving skills.</li>
<li>Teachers need to more consistently interpret and respond to the subtle cues and non-verbal communication offered by infants and toddlers.</li>
</ul><p>The review and improvement of teacher appraisal processes should include:</p><ul>
<li>relevant links to centre strategic direction and priorities</li>
<li>specific developmental goals focused on improving teacher practice</li>
<li>formal documented observations in relation to their goals</li>
<li>documented and specific feedback and feed forward in relation to improving outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Abbey's Place Childcare Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Abbey's Place Childcare Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dianne Moffitt</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p>16 July 2015</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
