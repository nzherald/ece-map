<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Giggles Learning Centre is well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Giggles Learning Centre, situated in the northern Whangarei suburb of Kensington, provides education and care for infants and for children over two years of age.</p><p>The centre was established in 2010 by co-owners who are committed to offering parents and wh&#257;nau a service that meets their aspirations and builds on their children&rsquo;s interests and strengths. Low staff turn-over and a high numbers of qualified teachers and staff in training are a feature of the centre.</p><p>This is the centre&rsquo;s first ERO review.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are well supported by teachers to develop social skills and to enhance their learning. As a result, children settle well to their play. They have opportunities to play independently and interact collaboratively with others. Teachers respond sensitively to infants&rsquo; and toddlers&rsquo; changing needs and preferences.</p><p>Teachers provide opportunities for children to explore and develop understandings about the natural environment and te ao M&#257;ori. Children play cooperatively and support each other in their learning. Children benefit from hearing and using te reo M&#257;ori, karakia and waiata in their play.</p><p>There are some good examples of teachers extending children&rsquo;s complex play. These models of sustained, extended play could provide a basis for developing greater consistency of good quality teaching and learning practice.</p><p>Teachers know children well and provide very good care. Warm, respectful relationships are evident between teachers and children, and with parents.</p><p>Consistent with the centre&rsquo;s philosophy of developing strong wh&#257;nau relationships, teachers provide children with opportunities to build on learning that occurs at home. Centre staff support parents by sharing ideas and resources that parents could use with their children. Centre leaders have used additional government funding to subsidise attendance fees for low income families.</p><p>Centre managers and staff work collaboratively to ensure ongoing centre improvement. Effective leadership and management impact positively on ongoing improvement.</p><p>Management structures provide opportunities for teachers to lead self review. Culturally inclusive centre practices have been informed by self review. Staff have sought feedback from families and the views of M&#257;ori organisations. Centre managers plan to build on current, effective self-review processes by revisiting the impact of initiatives and ensuring that more parent views are included in the centre&rsquo;s strategic planning.</p><p>Well considered programme planning responds to children&rsquo;s interests. Planning and assessment is closely aligned to <em>Te Whariki</em>, the New Zealand early childhood curriculum, and informed by current early childhood education theories. Learning stories in children&rsquo;s individual learning profiles are well recorded and show their progress over time.</p><p>To improve the programme, centre leaders have identified that staff could:</p><ul>
<li>further develop their ability to support child-led learning in the outdoor areas</li>
<li>incorporate more opportunities for early literacy and mathematics within the context of play</li>
<li>review how they support different children&rsquo;s play by using age appropriate resources.</li>
</ul><p>Management areas that have been identified for further development and review include:</p><ul>
<li>refining the centre&rsquo;s teacher appraisal process to include the Registered Teacher Criteria</li>
<li>linking professional learning and development to centre goals and strategic planning</li>
<li>communicating with parents in various ways about early childhood education principles and practice.</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO and centre managers agree that managers and teachers should further strengthen self review to improve teaching practices and curriculum implementation.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Giggles Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>17 April 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><p>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p><p>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p><p>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p><p>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of self review and partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews do not cover every aspect of service performance and each ERO report may cover different issues. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p></html>
