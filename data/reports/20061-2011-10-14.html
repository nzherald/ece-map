<html><a id="1-the-education-review-office-ero-evaluation" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1. The Education Review Office (ERO) Evaluation</h2><p align="left">Greenlane Childcare Centre is situated in Greenlane, Auckland. Staff continue to provide children with the good quality education and care in a homely environment identified in previous ERO reports.</p><p align="left"><span>Teachers plan thoughtfully to provide areas of play for children. Children settle well and their interests and strengths are well catered for by the programme. Children interact positively with each other and with their teachers. They are confident and show good self management. Younger children benefit from the centre&rsquo;s inclusive environment and they learn successfully alongside their older peers.</span></p><p align="left">Teachers work very well as a team and communicate effectively with each other about children&rsquo;s learning. <span>They recognise and respond promptly to children&rsquo;s emerging interests. Teachers are skilled at extending children&rsquo;s understandings through learning conversations. They document significant events well, using learning stories, descriptions and photographs. These are included in children's individual portfolios. Parents are encouraged to contribute their observations and comments to these records of learning.</span></p><p align="left"><span>The head teacher manages the centre effectively. She has provided opportunities for staff to contribute more to centre reviews that are focused on positive outcomes for children. Staff are well supported in their professional development.</span></p><p align="left"><span>ERO and centre management agree that</span> teachers should further develop partnerships with parents/wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children that focus on the parents&rsquo; aspirations and ways children&rsquo;s learning can be improved. The report also recommends that teachers should continue to share more with parents about how they respond to and build upon children&rsquo;s emerging interests.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p><a id="2-review-priorities" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2. Review Priorities</h2><h3>The Focus of the Review</h3><p align="left">Before the review, the management of Greenlane Childcare Centre was invited to consider its priorities for review using guidelines and resources provided by ERO. ERO also used documentation provided by the centre to contribute to the scope of the review.</p><p align="left">The detailed priorities for review were then determined following a discussion between the ERO review team and the management and staff. This discussion focused on existing information held by the centre (including self-review information) and the extent to which potential issues for review contributed to positive outcomes for children at Greenlane Childcare Centre.</p><p align="left">All ERO education reviews in early childhood focus on the quality of education. For ERO this includes the quality of:</p><ul>
<li>the programme provided for children;</li>
<li>the learning environment; and</li>
<li>the interactions between children and adults.</li>
</ul><h3>ERO&rsquo;s findings in these areas are set out below. The Quality of Education</h3><h4>Background</h4><p align="left">Since the 2007 ERO review, Greenlane Childcare Centre has been involved in several professional learning and development initiatives that have impacted positively on centre practices. Increasing shared leadership among staff has resulted in better decision-making about ways teachers can improve children&rsquo;s learning.</p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p align="left"><span>Interactions.</span><span>Children play and interact with others in positive ways that benefits learning. They are confident in seeking help from adults. The settled centre environment provides opportunities for children to involve themselves in purposeful play. Features of this play include:</span></p><ul>
<li>child-initiated conversations</li>
<li>teachers who listen and respond well to children&rsquo;s requests</li>
<li>collaborative interactions that result in extended periods of play.</li>
</ul><p align="left"><span>Language development.</span> <span>Teachers provide varied opportunities for children to develop their literacy skills. They model correct use of language and use open-ended questions well to promote thinking. Effective practices include:</span></p><ul>
<li>developing listening and questioning skills at mat times</li>
<li>developing oral language through dance and music</li>
<li>including writing meaningfully in areas of play</li>
<li>encouraging children to write their names on completed work.</li>
</ul><p align="left"><span>Supporting children&rsquo;s interests.</span> Teachers skilfully support children to follow their curiosity and see links with their learning. Some skilled staff extend children&rsquo;s thinking by asking high level questions and guiding children to resources related to their learning. Children have access to the internet and computer programmes. They receive good levels of support to develop and extend their interests.</p><p align="left">Professional learning and development. Managers and teachers value whole-centre professional development as an effective way to improve outcomes for children. Staff engage in ongoing discussion about developing centre programmes and professional practices. <span>There is a shared understanding among staff about the team work required to ensure the successful operation of the centre. The centre is very well run and provides a very good programme for children.</span></p><p align="left"><span>Self-review practices.</span> <span>The head teacher and staff ensure that policies and procedures are reviewed and implemented in an ongoing manner. The findings of the 2008 ERO review have been used as a basis for changes in centre practices focused on positive outcomes for children. Good review processes underpin on-going centre improvement.</span></p><h4>Area for development and review</h4><p align="left">Sharing children&rsquo;s progress. Staff could consider how they can more effectively help parents see their child&rsquo;s progress. Teachers could record their names on observations they have written, and date material more clearly so that progress over time is evident. Teachers should continue to develop strategies to communicate with parents about how they respond to and build upon children&rsquo;s emerging interests.</p><a id="3-national-evaluation-topic" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3. National Evaluation Topic</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p align="left">ERO provides information about the education system as a whole through its national reports. This information will be used as the basis for long term and systemic educational improvement.</p><h3>Partnerships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children in early childhood services</h3><p align="left">As part of this review ERO evaluated the extent to which:</p><ul>
<li>this service understands and values the identity, language and culture of M&#257;ori children and their wh&#257;nau, particularly when the child and wh&#257;nau transition to the service;</li>
<li>managers and educators have built relationships with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children;</li>
<li>this service works in partnership with wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children.</li>
</ul><h4>Background</h4><p align="left"><span>At the time of the review four children on the centre&rsquo;s roll identified as M&#257;ori. As a result of teachers&rsquo; commitment to the bi-cultural dimension of</span> <span>Te wh&#257;riki: the New Zealand early childhood curriculum,</span> <span>all children are provided with the opportunity to develop knowledge and an understanding of the cultural heritages of both partners to Te Tiriti o Waitangi.</span></p><h4>Areas of strength</h4><p align="left"><span>Inclusive practices.</span> <span>Staff provide opportunities for wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children to be involved in the life of the centre.</span> <span>They ask parents for advice in resourcing areas of play with a bi-cultural theme.</span></p><p align="left"><span>Integration of te reo and tikanga M&#257;ori</span> <span>Teachers use te reo M&#257;ori and sing waiata with children. They practise their pronunciation and use of te reo M&#257;ori. This aspect of the programme helps M&#257;ori children and their families/wh&#257;nau develop a sense of belonging to the centre.</span></p><h4>Areas for development and review</h4><p align="left">Strengthening partnerships. Teachers should further develop partnerships with parents/wh&#257;nau that focus on their aspirations and ways M&#257;ori children&rsquo;s learning can be improved.</p><a id="4-management-assurance-on-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>4. Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h2><p align="left">Before the review, the staff of Greenlane Childcare Centre completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration;</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare;</li>
<li>personnel management; and</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p align="left">During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s documentation, including policies, procedures and records of recent use of procedures. ERO also checked elements of the following areas that have a potentially high impact on outcomes for children:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including behaviour management, prevention of bullying and abuse);</li>
<li>physical safety (including behaviour management, sleeping and supervision practices; accidents and medication; hygiene and routines; travel and excursion policies and procedures);</li>
<li>staff qualifications and organisation; and</li>

</table><a id="to-the-parents-and-community-of-greenlane-childcare-centre" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>To the Parents and Community of Greenlane Childcare Centre</h2><p align="left">These are the findings of the Education Review Office&rsquo;s latest report on Greenlane Childcare Centre.</p><p align="left">Greenlane Childcare Centre is situated in Greenlane, Auckland. Staff continue to provide children with the good quality education and care in a homely environment identified in previous ERO reports.</p><p align="left"><span>Teachers plan thoughtfully to provide areas of play for children. Children settle well and their interests and strengths are well catered for by the programme. Children interact positively with each other and with their teachers. They are confident and show good self management. Younger children benefit from the centre&rsquo;s inclusive environment and they learn successfully alongside their older peers.</span></p><p align="left">Teachers work very well as a team and communicate effectively with each other about children&rsquo;s learning. <span>They recognise and respond promptly to children&rsquo;s emerging interests. Teachers are skilled at extending children&rsquo;s understandings through learning conversations. They document significant events well, using learning stories, descriptions and photographs. These are included in children's individual portfolios. Parents are encouraged to contribute their observations and comments to these records of learning.</span></p><p align="left"><span>The head teacher manages the centre effectively. She has provided opportunities for staff to contribute more to centre reviews that are focused on positive outcomes for children. Staff are well supported in their professional development.</span></p><p align="left"><span>ERO and centre management agree that</span> teachers should further develop partnerships with parents/wh&#257;nau of M&#257;ori children that focus on the parents&rsquo; aspirations and ways children&rsquo;s learning can be improved. The report also recommends that teachers should continue to share more with parents about how they respond to and build upon children&rsquo;s emerging interests.</p><h3>Future Action</h3><p align="left">ERO is confident that the service is being managed in the interest of the children. Therefore ERO is likely to review the service again within three years.</p><p align="left">When ERO has reviewed an early childhood centre we encourage management to inform their community of any follow up action they plan to take. You should talk to the management or contact person if you have any questions about this evaluation, the full ERO report or their future intentions.&nbsp;</p><p align="left">If you would like a copy of the full report, please contact the centre or see the ERO website, http://www.ero.govt.nz.&nbsp;</p><p align="left">Richard Thornton</p><p align="left">National Manager Review Services</p><p align="left">Northern Region</p><a id="page-17153" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2><span style="font-size: 10px;">&nbsp;</span></h2></html>
