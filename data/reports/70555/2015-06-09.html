</tr></tbody></table><p>Gloriavale Christian Community Garden of Children 1 is very well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p>
<p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Gloriavale Christian Community Garden of Children 1 is one of three centres that operates within the Gloriavale Christian Community complex.</p>
<p>Since the June 2011 ERO reviews, this centre has been relicensed to cater for 80 children aged between three to six years old. There are two supervisors who each take responsibility for one of the two groups of children aged three and four years old and four-to-six years old. The centre increased the inside play space to include a separate area for older children. The outside area provides opportunities for all of the children in this centre to play together.</p>
<p>The supervisors and teachers have been very responsive to ERO recommendations in the 2011 review. They have made significant and ongoing improvements to the management and curriculum systems and practices. This includes: long and short-term planning, self review, appraisal and teacher registration systems. All teachers are qualified or in training to become early childhood teachers.</p>
<p>This review was part of a cluster of three early childhood centres reviews in the Gloriavale Christian Community.</p>
<h3>The Review Findings</h3>
<p>The Christian philosophy of the community and centre is highly evident in all aspects of centre operation and practice.</p>
<p>The experienced and knowledgeable supervisors from all of the centres work well together. They provide strong leadership and direction for the teaching teams. Supervisors have high expectations of teaching practices and learning outcomes for children.</p>
<p>Supervisors and teachers have made very good use of targeted, internal and external professional development to strengthen the effectiveness of management, and curriculum systems and practices. Appraisal systems, including the registered teacher criteria, are well used to continually strengthen teachers’ practice. This includes robust processes in place to support those teachers still in training.</p>
<p>Children’s transitions into, and between centres and onto school are well supported. Supervisors and teachers foster close partnerships with families to support children’s learning and wellbeing. They provide an inclusive learning culture that is very responsive to the needs of children and families, particularly those children with special educational needs. Supervisors and teachers work collaboratively with specialist services and provide additional one-on-one support when needed.</p>
<p>The programme is reflective of the community's values and beliefs, and includes a local context. Teachers follow children’s interests and promote higher level thinking and problem solving. Children have good opportunities to be involved in a range of literacy learning experiences. The supervisors and teachers have developed a shared understanding of what this will look like as children progress through the centres and on to school.</p>
<p>Supervisors and teachers value parent and community involvement in the centre. Trips into the local community environment enhance the learning programme offered to children.</p>
<p>External professional support is helping teachers to place an increasing focus on providing a bicultural curriculum. The Māori culture is woven naturally through the programme in ways that are meaningful for children.</p>
<p>Families are provided with detailed information about their children’s progress and participation in the programme through well-presented and informative profile books. Parents are actively encouraged to regularly contribute to their children’s learning.</p>
<p>The manager and supervisors work well together. They communicate effectively and respect the contribution that they each make to the effective operation of the centre. There is strong alignment between long and short term centre planning and the community’s priorities. Supervisors promote a culture of reflective practice amongst teachers. They make good use of self review to strengthen teaching practices and support children’s learning. A strong and ongoing emphasis is placed on improvement to promote positive outcomes for children.</p>
<h3>Key Next Steps</h3>
<p>The manager and supervisors have identified that their next step is find ways to ensure that newly introduced management and curriculum practices are manageable. ERO agrees that these new systems need to be refined and embedded to build sustainability and capability amongst the whole teaching team.</p>
<h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3>
<p>Before the review, the staff and management of Gloriavale Christian Community Garden of Children 1 completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p>
<h3>Next ERO Review</h3>
<h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4>
<p>The next ERO review of Gloriavale Christian Community Garden of Children 1 will be in four years.</p>

<h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3>
<p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p>

<h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3>
<p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here:</a></p>
<p><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p>
<p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p>
<p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p>
<p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p>
<p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p>
<h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3>
<p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p>
<ul><li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p>
<h4>Review Coverage</h4>
<p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
