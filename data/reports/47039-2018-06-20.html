</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>New Shoots Children’s Centre (Sandhurst) is located in Papamoa. It is licensed to provide all-day education and care for 75 children including 28 aged under two. The current roll of 92 includes 15 children who identify as Māori and 23 children from a range of other cultural heritages.</p><p>The purpose-built centre opened in July 2016. Since opening, considered appointments have been made to align with the strategic direction and New Shoots organisation’s philosophy. The teaching team consists of experienced early childhood educators, new graduates, students and provisionally certificated teachers.</p><p>There are four aged-based rooms within the centre to cater for children aged 3 months to school age. The rooms are known as – Pipis (3 months to 1 year), Paua (1 to 2 years), Kina (2 to 3.5 years) and Taniwha (3.5 years to school age). A large outdoor environment is well resourced with a natural world focus. Children are able to move freely between the indoor and outdoor spaces. This provides opportunities for children to develop relationships with a wider range of peers.</p><p>The centre philosophy emphasises the development of relationships based on integrity, respect, nurture and trust. This centre is privately owned by three educators who are qualified in early childhood education and also own and govern centres in Tauranga, Auckland and Hamilton. A centre director oversees management and leadership of the Sandhurst Centre. She is supported by an assistant centre director.</p><p>This is the first ERO evaluation for this centre.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Empowering children’s independence and choice clearly underpins teaching and learning. Teachers value and encourage aspirations for children. Positive respectful relationships with parents and whānau underpin a strong sense of belonging and connectedness. Nurturing and respectful interactions between teachers and children are highly evident. The purposeful learning environment adds complexity and challenge to children’s ideas, interests and working theories. The centre has identified the development of teachers' confidence and competence in te reo and tikanga Māori as an ongoing priority for the centre. This should further acknowledge and extend connections for children to their culture, language and identity, and the local environment.</p><p>Transitions into, through and out of the centre are highly effective. A calm and unhurried environment for children under the age of two provides them space and time to lead their own learning. Teachers use learning opportunities within routines to extend children's knowledge and understanding. Whānau-support teachers work with children and their family's for successful transition into the centre. This ensures highly responsive care that nurtures children’s positive sense of self.</p><p>There is a comprehensive and well-considered approach to supporting children with additional needs. Strong relationships with external agencies, alongside parents and whānau provide collaborative wrap-around support. Teachers' knowledge and understanding is built through well-considered professional learning. Children engage in meaningful learning experiences that are responsive to their needs.</p><p>A wide range of learning experiences fosters children’s curiosity and risk taking. Learning journals celebrate children’s participation in centre life and reflect their progress and development. The <em>New Shoots Curriculum</em> guides expectations for high-quality teaching and learning. Assessment, planning and evaluation recognises and extends children’s emerging interests, strengths and needs. Children's confidence and friendships are developed and supported through the mixed-age outdoor environment. The purposefully planned approach is respectful and responsive to the individual child’s needs and readiness, in collaboration with whānau.</p><p>Effective leadership has built a highly positive and collaborative culture. Leaders and teachers feel highly valued and respected. A focused and coherent approach to building teacher capacity and capability through self review supports ongoing centre-wide improvements. Leaders have a strong commitment to teaching and learning that advocates positive outcomes for all children.</p><p>A clear strategic direction outlines priorities and goals for continued improvement. The vision is evident throughout teaching practice and the learning environment. The centre is well supported by the New Shoots organisation. Highly-effective systems monitor the physical and emotional health and safety for all children.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and centre leaders agree that the key next step is to continue to develop teachers' confidence and competence in te reo and tikanga Māori to acknowledge children's language, culture and identity.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of New Shoots Children's Centre - Sandhurst completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of New Shoots Children's Centre - Sandhurst will be in four years.</p><p>Lynda Pura-Watson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer</p><p><span>Te Tai Miringa - Waikato / Bay of Plenty Region</span></p><p>20 June 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
