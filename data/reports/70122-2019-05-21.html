</table><p>Southbridge Playcentre is well placed but requires additional support to address the next steps identified in this report.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Southbridge Playcentre operates as a parent cooperative under the governance and management of the Playcentre Federation, Upper South Island Region. This centre is licensed for 24 children, including 10 under two years of age. The centre operates three sessions a week and is the only early childhood service in the Southbridge community.</p><p>The playcentre employs a centre coordinator who has been in this position for a number of years. Parents are rostered to help at each session. A number of new parents have recently joined Southbridge Playcentre and are becoming familiar with how the parent cooperative operates. The Upper South Island Region employs a centre support person and an administrator who regularly visit the playcentre to support the parents and coordinator in their roles.</p><p>The Southbridge Playcentre philosophy emphasises the important role of parents in their children's learning and wellbeing, and children and adults learning together through play. The playcentre's mission statement prioritises strong connections with the community so that parents can support and learn from each other.</p><p>The parent cooperative need to further improve the recommendations identified in the 2014 ERO report. Learning assessment and planning, bicultural inclusion, and increasing participation in the playcentre parent education programme remain as areas for further development.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of six reviews in the Playcentre Federation, Upper South Island Region.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children enjoy learning and playing in an inclusive, friendly environment. Relationships between children and adults are respectful and positive. New families and children are warmly welcomed into the centre. Adults take the necessary time to respond to children's learning interests and needs, and support children to develop a sense of belonging and wellbeing.</p><p>Children are encouraged to be active explorers and problem solvers. They confidently make their own choices from the wide variety of activities and learning experiences in the programme. Parents use a range of useful strategies to extend children's interests, encourage exploration, creativity and support children to lead their own learning.</p><p>Children participate in a well-established local curriculum. This includes strong connections with their community and primary school. Adults ensure there are opportunities for children to have regular excursions and involvement with the local community. This helps children make use of these experiences to build their knowledge, extend their play and make sense of the world.</p><p>Children under-two-years of age are well supported. Parents and children have often participated in the 'Babies can play' programme. This helps them transition easily into the play centre programme. Older children play well with and alongside younger children and show interest in what they are doing. Tuakana-teina relationships are clearly evident as children of mixed ages play together.</p><p>The playcentre's strategic plan needs to be strengthened and refined to provide clearer direction-setting for the centre. Internal evaluation processes are becoming established. Along with building leadership capability, the playcentre needs to continue and embed this development.</p><p>Te reo and tikanga Māori are in the early stages of development in programmes and practices. The centre now needs to further develop and embed bicultural practices across centre operations and documentation.</p><p>The centre parents and coordinator reported to ERO that they are well supported by the Upper South Island Regional Hub.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The parent cooperative and ERO agree that the key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>strengthening and extending the use of te reo and tikanga Māori in the programme and centre documentation</li>
<li>improving assessment and planning practices and documentation, including increasing parent involvement and making children's home cultures more visible in these processes</li>
<li>building leadership capacity within the parent cooperative</li>
<li>improving internal evaluation and strategic planning in ways that promote positive learning and wellbeing outcomes for all children.</li>
</ul><p>ERO recommends that the Upper South Island Regional Hub support the centre to address the key areas for improvement identified in this report.</p><p>ERO will maintain an ongoing relationship with the playcentre to monitor and evaluate progress against these key areas for improvement.</p><h3>Upper South Island Regional Governance</h3><p>There continues to be significant change occurring with the playcentre's governance and management at regional and federation levels.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Southbridge Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Alan Wynyard</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services Southern</p><p><span>Southern Region</span></p><p>21 May 2019</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
