</tr></tbody></table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Akoteu Fakailimo’ui is a Tongan language immersion service in Mangere East, alongside the Selusalema Church of Tonga. It is licensed to provide education and care for 30 children, including up to five children aged under two years. Most of the children attending have Tongan heritage.</p>
<p>The centre operates under the governance of the Siasi O Tongan (NZ) Trust Board with a management committee of church, parent, and staff representatives. The centre has five registered teachers who are supported by three unqualified staff.</p>
<p>The 2013 ERO report recommended that the committee and teachers improve self review and programme planning to promote a more responsive programme for children. With the assistance of relevant professional support, teachers and the committee have responded positively to these recommendations.</p>
<h3>The Review Findings</h3>
<p>The centre’s philosophy is enacted well. There is a focus on Christian and Tongan values and the programme for children is based on <em>Te Wh</em><em>ā</em><em>riki</em>, the early childhood curriculum. The philosophy is research based, with an increasing influence of Reggio Emelia and Magda Gerber approaches.</p>
<p>Children are settled in an attractive and well-resourced environment. They are confident and know centre routines well. Supportive, positive interactions among children and teachers have fostered a strong sense of wellbeing and belonging. Children have good opportunities to explore and make choices in their play. They enjoy opportunities for singing, movement and imaginative play.</p>
<p>Infants and toddlers mix well with other children and are well supported to develop independence. A separate indoor play space is provided for younger children to spend some of their day.</p>
<p>Teachers’ recent professional learning and their commitment to developing their practice and planning has helped to improve the programme for children. The programme is increasingly responsive to children’s interests with a focus on learning through play. Teachers follow children’s lead and support their play. Learning stories have a clear focus on celebrating children’s learning.</p>
<p>The Tongan language is modelled and well used by teachers and children are encouraged to talk in Tongan. The transition to school programme includes regular visits to a Tongan bilingual class at a local school.</p>
<p>Teachers’ increasing involvement in decision making has prompted good progress in the centre programme and operations. The committee’s recent professional learning has helped them to be more aware of their role in supporting teachers to promote children’s learning and well-being.</p>
<p>The committee and head teacher have improved the centre’s policy framework, strategic plan and personnel management system. A staff appraisal system has been implemented and should be strengthened to meet recent Education Council requirements. There are good support systems in place for professional learning and sharing effective practice. Teachers are increasingly considering best practice in early childhood education to make learning a positive experience for children.</p>
<h3>Key Next Steps</h3>
<p>The committee and head teacher have identified appropriate development priorities that include:</p>
<ul><li>maintaining professional learning to continue developing a programme for children that encourages curiosity, discovery and creativity</li>
<li>offering children more opportunities to share their experiences, questions and opinions to develop more complex Tongan language skills</li>
<li>further promoting parents’ involvement in their children’s learning</li>
<li>using an annual action plan to guide and monitor ongoing centre improvement.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3>
<p>Before the review, the staff and management of Akoteu Fakailimo'ui completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p>
<ul><li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p>
<ul><li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p>
<p>To improve centre practices, the committee should ensure that all non-registered staff are police vetted on employment and every three years.</p>
<h3>Next ERO Review</h3>
<h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4>
<p>The next ERO review of Akoteu Fakailimo'ui will be in three years.</p>

<h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3>
<p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p>

<h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3>
<p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here:</a></p>
<p><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</p>
<p><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</p>
<p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p>
<p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p>
<p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p>
<p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p>
<h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3>
<p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p>
<ul><li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p>
<h4>Review Coverage</h4>
<p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
