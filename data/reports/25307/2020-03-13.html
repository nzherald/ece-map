</table><p>Kauri Kids Papatoetoe is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Kauri Kids Papatoetoe is one of 11 Kauri Kids community-based childcare centres owned by the Auckland Council. It operates within the Allan Brewster Recreation Centre. It is licensed for full-day education and care for 66 children, including 15 children under two years of age. A non-permanent head teacher leads the long-serving teaching team comprising of four qualified and three unqualified teachers.</p><p>The philosophy of the organisation is based on setting an environment that empowers children to lead their own learning. Strong emphasis is placed on building partnerships with whānau based on trust, respect and the best interests of each child. Te Tiriti O Waitangi and <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, are recognised as guiding documents.</p><p>Children play in one large room with easy access to an outdoor play area. Infants and toddlers have their own indoor and outdoor areas.</p><p>The Kauri Kids centres are managed centrally by Auckland Council. Kauri Kids, as part of Auckland Council, provide a governance and management framework, and support personnel to assist centres. An early childhood education (ECE) operations manager is responsible for the overall operation of the Kauri Kids services. The head teacher in each service reports to the centre manager of the leisure centre facility where the service is based.</p><p>The 2016 ERO report identified areas of good practice, some of which have been maintained. Areas identified for ongoing improvement have not yet been addressed.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of four education and care reviews in the Auckland-wide Kauri Kids organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre’s philosophy is highly evident in practice and the environment. Children demonstrate a sense of belonging as they explore their environment and engage with a range of resources. Respectful interactions between teachers and children contribute to children's sense of belonging.</p><p>Children settle well and play co-operatively in the spacious indoor and outdoor areas. They choose their activities, make decisions and negotiate with each other during imaginative play.</p><p>The small group of infants and toddlers benefit from learning in an environment that supports exploration and risk taking. Although these younger children are accommodated in a separate area, they mix with the older children at the beginning and end of the day.</p><p>Teachers’ emphasis on children learning together helps children grow their communication skills and social competence. Some teachers are highly responsive to children’s cues, interests and dispositions. It would be useful for teachers to consider ways to engage children in more meaningful conversations to encourage their oral language, vocabulary building and more complex thinking.</p><p>The head teacher demonstrates a strong commitment to enhancing staff knowledge and skills through ongoing appropriate professional learning and development (PLD). She is supporting teachers to gain a shared understanding of the centre’s philosophy and how to plan for it in the learning curriculum.</p><p>Transition processes into the centre and between age groups are thoughtfully considered. In order to foster successful transition to school, the head teacher has identified the need to establish relationships with the local schools.</p><p>Parents’ perspectives are sought and valued. A beneficial range of communication strategies successfully promote parent involvement in their child’s social and emotional development, and in centre and community events. Children’s learning portfolios show their participation and engagement in the curriculum.</p><p>The ECE operations manager oversees the centres. She implements appropriate processes to increase head teacher communication and develops a shared understanding of the philosophy. Kauri Kids provides a comprehensive framework of policies and procedures and a robust appraisal process. Internal evaluation frameworks are now being established.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The head teacher and ECE curriculum leader acknowledge that their next steps are to strengthen:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>teachers’ understanding of urges and uninterrupted play education to inform individual planning and demonstrate how teachers are supporting all children to progress their learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>teachers’ understanding and use of evaluation to recognise what is working for children’s learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Key Next Steps for the governing organisation</h3><p>It would be beneficial for Kauri Kids to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>continue to offer leadership PLD and provide opportunities to further enhance the leadership skills of head teachers and teachers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>deepen educators' use of planning, assessment and evaluation processes for children’s ongoing learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue to identify how well new initiatives have impacted on learning outcomes for children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ensure children have opportunities to experience and enhance their language, culture and identity.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Kauri Kids Papatoetoe completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>Steve Tanner</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services (Northern)</p><p><span>Northern Region - Te Tai Raki</span></p><p>13 March 2020</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/" target="_blank"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes will depend on how well the service promotes positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Very well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well placed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requires further development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not well placed</p>
</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="https://www.ero.govt.nz/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/" target="_blank">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
