</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Newcastle Kindergarten, located in the town of Ngaruawahia, is licensed for 50 children. The kindergarten offers both full and part-day education and care for children from two years to school age. At the time of this ERO review 50 children were enrolled, including 23 who identify as Māori.</p><p>The kindergarten is one of 29 kindergartens that operate under the Waikato Kindergarten Association (WKA), which is a charitable trust. The strategic direction of the association is guided by the overarching statement, ‘Our children are strong in heart, head and hand’. The WKA has a commitment to providing quality, inclusive services that effectively meet the diverse educational needs of all children attending. Advice, guidance and support is provided to the organisation by a kaumātua from Tainui.</p><p>All kindergartens in the WKA are involved in a ‘Cool 4 School’ transition programme and sustainable education, environment and health programmes such as Enviroschools and Sport Waikato 'Under 5 Energise'. The kindergartens’ education, operational and administrative responsibilities are supported by experienced association personnel.</p><p>The kindergartens’ philosophy aims to encourage children to develop a love of learning, imagination and creativity. It states that they 'promote a sense of belonging for all children and their families through responsive and reciprocal relationships'. The Treaty of Waitangi is valued and what children and their families bring with them is respected. The kindergarten believes that through sustainable practices and nurturing the environment children develop to their potential.</p><p>Since the last ERO review in 2014, there have been extensive renovations to the exterior of the kindergarten and some changes to the teaching team. Assessment practices have been strengthened and an online portfolio system has been implemented.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of three reviews in the Waikato Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Collaborative and respectful relationships with children and their whānau are effectively fostered and valued by teachers. Connections between the kindergarten and home supports teachers' knowledge of children, their whānau and the local community. Teachers genuinely listen to, recognise and celebrate children’s interests and strengths. They encourage children's language development through rich conversation. Teachers successfully focus on developing positive relationships between children, creating a culture of care and empathy. Children are considered confident, competent and are curious about the world around them.</p><p>The curriculum is effective and promotes wellbeing and a sense of belonging for all. Teachers' facilitate meaningful and authentic learning experiences that promote children's dispositional learning. They have good knowledge of children as learners and follow their interests. High levels of collaboration with whānau that supports a responsive approach to meeting children's abilities, needs and strengths. Assessment builds a picture of what children experience as they participate in the learning environment. Literacy and numeracy is authentically woven throughout play, it is visible and acknowledged. Children experience a curriculum that provides a wide range of experiences for learning.</p><p>The environment is well prepared and resourced promoting learning that is inclusive for all children. Children with additional needs are effectively supported to achieve their learning outcomes. Transitions into and out of the kindergarten are individualised and responsive. Authentic learning through the 'bush kindy' programme and connections with the community enrich the meaningful local curriculum. Children’s learning and sense of self is enhanced through real-life learning experiences where strong connections and links to the natural environment and community are well supported.</p><p>Māori learners are supported to achieve success as Māori. A bicultural curriculum is visible and te ao Māori is a strong and vibrant feature of the kindergarten where Māori perspectives such as manaakitanga, whanaungatanga, kotahitanga, and ako are highly valued. Te reo and tikanga Māori are promoted through the use of waiata and karakia. Children are supported to make connections to the unique heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand through a localised curriculum which acknowledges Kingitanga, Tainui and through a strong sense of tūrangawaewae.</p><p>Leaders promote an effective approach for teachers to build their professional knowledge. Strong community relationships and connections through agencies, schools, local iwi and places of significance are championed by leaders. Internal evaluation has been strengthened, it is responsive and leads to change and improvement. The philosophy has been recently reviewed in consultation with the community. Leaders promote strong advocacy for children and their whānau.</p><p>Education services managers (ESMs) work closely with the head teacher and provide well-informed professional leadership to support kindergarten operation. The WKA has recently reviewed its teacher appraisal process. Ensuring this new process is fully implemented is a priority for ESMs.</p><p>The WKA provides comprehensive systems, policies and procedures to guide kindergarten practice. Teachers have access to ongoing and targeted professional development to promote improved practice and contribute to positive outcomes for children. Effective governance by the WKA is contributing to inclusive and equitable services for children.</p><h3><span style="font-size: 1em;">Key Next Steps</span></h3><p>The key next steps for leaders and teachers are to further strengthen their understanding about the expectations of the revised <em>Te Whāriki</em> particularly in relation to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>individual planning, assessment and evaluation of children's learning to prioritise learner outcomes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening the visibility of all children's language, culture and identity throughout the programme</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>progress and increasing complexity of children's learning over time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>embedding online systems to support teaching and learning.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Teachers and leaders also need to review the programme and opportunities that children have to manage themselves and make their own choices.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Newcastle Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Newcastle Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Phil Cowie</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p>Central <span>Region</span></p><p>20 December 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
