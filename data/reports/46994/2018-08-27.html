</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Home2Grow Childcare 3 is one of three home-based education and care networks owned by Home2Grow Limited. It provides an early childhood education and care service for up to 60 children from infancy to school age. Educators provide programmes in their homes for up to four children at a time. A high number of Pacific families and other diverse groups use the service. Some of the educators are the children's family members such as grandparents. This is the first ERO review of Home2Grow Childcare 3.</p><p>Home2Grow Limited is led by an owner/managing director and a newly appointed senior programme coordinator who work collaboratively with programme coordinators, administrators, educators and whānau. The managing director, senior programme coordinator and programme coordinators are registered early childhood teachers. They regularly visit educators in their homes, support them to plan educational programmes for children, and monitor health and safety provisions.</p><p>Key aspects of the service's philosophy focus on the child at the heart of the matter. The philosophy highlights an environment that inspires and encourages learning. Respectful and trustful relationships between parents, educators and coordinators are promoted. Staff value and are committed to te reo and tikanga Māori. The learning programme is underpinned by <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the early childhood curriculum.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Pacific children and families are well supported and valued. Programme coordinators work with educators to promote a culturally responsive curriculum, based on maintaining children's language and sense of cultural identity. They are respectful of each family's beliefs and values and aim to match educators and families that speak the same home language.</p><p>Educators keep good records and note activities enjoyed in individual children's daily diaries. Records indicate that children have fun, make choices, and are confident in their language and culture. As a result, children have a strong sense of belonging.</p><p>Children have portfolios that show a variety of learning experiences and include early literacy, mathematics and science. Portfolios show children participating in activities that support their interests and in regular excursions in the community.</p><p>Children have opportunities to learn as part of a larger group in playgroups. These provide good opportunities for educators to learn about and collaborate on how environments, equipment and quality interactions can be used to promote learning. Programme coordinators model good practice and educators have leadership roles during playgroup sessions.</p><p>Children are sensitively supported to transition into educators’ homes in a collaborative process with educators, parents and coordinators. Educators provide individualised nurturing care. They are aware of the preferences, learning and development needs of infants and toddlers. Parents give positive feedback about their children's care and education.</p><p>Service leaders have a strong commitment to inclusion and equitable positive learning outcomes for all children. A service-wide belief in the cultural and educational benefits of home-based learning for children and their families, underpins operations.</p><p>Coordinators' monthly visit records show that coordinators model planning and teaching approaches, and the writing of learning stories. Educators receive ongoing individual conferencing from coordinators. Coordinators spend time listening, supporting and coaching educators to develop children to lead their learning.</p><p>Service leaders, coordinators and administrators work collaboratively to manage the service. Clearly defined roles are guided by the service's vision, philosophy and strategic direction. Policies and practices reflect the service's high expectations for coordinators and educators. Leaders are purposeful and collaborative with internal evaluation. The structured process is supporting leaders to be improvement focused.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Key next steps to improve operations and professional practices include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>further developing an annual plan that reflects the service's strategic priorities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to build leadership capacity and capability within the team</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>building capability in planning and assessing children's learning and in evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>refining coordinators' monthly visit reports to clearly show children's learning progress, additional learning supports, health and safety monitoring and next steps for educators</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>strengthening children’s individual portfolios to explicitly show children's identity, culture and language, continuity of learning, and whānau and educator contributions.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Home2Grow Childcare 3 completed an ERO Home-based Education and Care Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Home2Grow Childcare 3 will be in three years.</p><p>Julie Foley</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Northern (Acting)</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>27 August 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-home-based-education-and-care-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Home-based Education and Care Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li>Pou Whakahaere – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou Ārahi – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Mātauranga – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to the draft methodology for ERO reviews in Home-based Education and Care Services: July 2014</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
