</table><p>With targeted association support, Wairoa kindergarten is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Wairoa Kindergarten is licensed for 43 children aged over two years. The current roll is 45, including 30 Māori and four Pacific children.</p><p>The kindergarten is part of the Napier Kindergarten Association, which oversees the operations of 16 kindergartens, including two based in Wairoa. A board of trustees oversees governance for the association with support of the general manager. Two education managers have a responsibility for building teacher capability. The experienced head teacher provides professional leadership to a cohesive team. A recently appointed Pou Whakarewa Mātauranga supports teachers to develop their knowledge and understanding of te ao Māori. He demonstrates a clear vision for Māori children and their whānau.</p><p>The kindergarten serves a diverse range of families from the urban and rural communities of Wairoa. Since the October 2012 ERO report, the kindergarten has introduced and operates five, six-hour sessions, Monday to Friday. The roll now includes two year olds.</p><p>The kindergarten is part of the Enviroschools programme.</p><p>Areas identified for improvement in the previous ERO report have yet to be fully addressed. This report contains significant areas requiring review and development.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of seven kindergarten reviews in the Napier Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>There is a strong focus on promoting children's wellbeing through positive and caring relationships between teachers, children and families. Providing positive guidance to support children's emotional and social competence is a priority. Teachers must review the effectiveness of strategies in place to support these aspects.</p><p>Teachers have developed and are implementing more responsive planning, linked to each child's interests, needs and parent aspirations. This continues to be an area for development.</p><p>Profile books are attractive records of children’s participation in activities. Special moments and celebrations are acknowledged. Parents’ contributions are welcomed and valued. Teachers are in the early stages of introducing e-portfolios. They are exploring ways to ensure that all parents have access so that their contributions to learning are strengthened.</p><p>Further work is needed by teachers to effectively promote positive learning outcomes for younger children. Several children aged two attend the kindergarten. Review of resources and equipment has resulted in increased care routines and physical activity. The programme requires further development to be responsive to this age group.</p><p>Children with diverse needs are warmly welcomed. Teachers work collaboratively with parents, whānau and external agencies to support children's participation in the programme. Teachers should monitor children's progress and how well the curriculum supports their learning goals.</p><p>There is an increased focus on incorporating te ao Māori linked to the local area into the programme. Native planting has been established that encourages children to engage with nature. Teachers have received parent support to grow their knowledge and understanding of te ao Māori. The use of te reo Māori and culturally responsive practices is an area for ongoing development.</p><p>Teachers have made limited progress in using self review to support improvement. It remains an area for ongoing teacher development. The appraisal process requires further strengthening to support growth in teaching practices.</p><p>The association, through the education managers must support teachers to address the identified priorities in this report to improve the education and care for children. These include curriculum development, assessment, planning, self review and internal evaluation, appraisal and leadership.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The kindergarten teachers and education managers should:</p><p>improve the responsiveness of the curriculum for children and the effectiveness of positive guidance</p><p>continue to improve assessment, planning and evaluation for individual children</p><ul>
<li>
<p>improve teachers' knowledge and use of self review and internal evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improve appraisal processes, including goal setting, and the use of evidence and feedback in relation to the Practising Teacher Criteria.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Progress against an action plan that addresses the key next steps will be monitored by ERO.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Wairoa Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>curriculum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premises and facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>health and safety practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>governance, management and administration.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Wairoa Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Central</p><p>20 April 2016</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup><colgroup><col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
