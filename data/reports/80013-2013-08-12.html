</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Macandrew Bay is one of three privately owned Family Ties Educare centres. It is licensed for 30 children. However, the owner chooses to have a maximum of 20 at the centre in order to keep a low number of children with each teacher. The centre provides full-day care and education for children from 10 months to 5 years.</p><p>This centre was purchased by Family Ties Educare in October 2011. The current owner took full control in 2013.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of three centres in the Family Ties Educare organisation.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>ERO has noted significant improvement in the environment, programme and practices since Family Ties Educare commenced operating the centre in 2011. Children play and learn in a clean, tidy and well-organised environment. Teachers have worked hard to create a family-like environment where small groups of children can work and play. Teachers have nurturing and positive relationships with children. ERO observed teachers and children having fun together. Children are developing close friendships with each other. They play happily for sustained periods. Teachers know the children and their families well and show a genuine interest in children’s lives beyond the centre.</p><p>Children confidently approach their teachers and settle quickly into prepared activities on arrival. They benefit from a wide range of group activities in a structured programme. Children are developing a good understanding of literacy and numeracy concepts which have a strong emphasis within the programme. Teachers use daily group times effectively to develop children’s oral language. In these contexts, children experience and confidently join in a variety of songs, rhymes, waiata and movement.</p><p>Children’s individual profile books provide an attractive record of their experiences at the centre. These show good links to the early childhood curriculum and some analysis of the child’s learning.</p><p>The management team is further developing useful guidelines and expectations for the three Family Ties Educare centres.</p><p>These include:</p><ul>
<li>expectations for group planning and teacher reflection</li>
<li>a recently reviewed centre philosophy to guide the teachers in their work</li>
<li>expectations as to how teachers support children to become socially competent.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers feel very well supported by the management team. They value their ongoing professional conversations and learning.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The next steps for teachers are to improve children’s learning records to better show how they:</p><ul>
<li>plan for and extend children’s individual learning over time</li>
<li>include and respond to parents’ contributions to their children’s learning.</li>
</ul><p>The management team and ERO have identified that the next steps for the Family Ties Educare organisation are to:</p><ul>
<li>further develop long-term plans to guide the centre’s direction</li>
<li>deepen teachers’ and managers’ understanding of effective self review</li>
<li>review and monitor the effectiveness of all aspects of the operation of the service over time</li>
<li>complete the development of policies, procedures and guidelines related to curriculum implementation and human-resource management in preparation for relicensing under the 2008 Early Childhood Regulations and Licensing Criteria.</li>
<li>improve and formalise the support for provisionally registered teachers</li>
<li>further develop and implement a rigorous appraisal process.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the management of Family Ties Educare - Macandrew Bay completed an ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>administration</li>
<li>health, safety and welfare</li>
<li>personnel management</li>
<li>financial and property management.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Family Ties Educare - Macandrew Bay will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Southern Region</p><p>12 August 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em>.</em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
