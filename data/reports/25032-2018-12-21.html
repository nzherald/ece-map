</table><p>Manurewa West Kindergarten is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Manurewa West Kindergarten is a well-established kindergarten licensed for 30 children two years of age and over. It operates daily from 8.00 am to 5.00 pm. The majority of children are of Māori or Pacific heritage.</p><p>The kindergarten is part of the Counties Manukau Kindergarten Association (CMKA) and operates under its policies and management framework. A CMKA education manager (EM) visits the kindergarten and provides leadership and curriculum support for teachers. The CMKA is in the process of reviewing its structures and operational framework.</p><p>The kindergarten's philosophy values child-initiated, play-based approaches to learning and promotes tuakana/teina relationships. The teaching team includes a head teacher, two other registered teachers, an administrator, and a teacher aide.</p><p>In 2015, ERO identified good practices, including child-initiated play and teachers valuing children's home languages. These practices continue to be present. Areas for improvement included assessment, planning, internal evaluation and opportunities for more complex play. Some progress has been made in these areas.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of eight reviews in the CMKA.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children settle easily into the learning programme and are supported to develop a sense of belonging. They greet and welcome other children, parents and visitors as they arrive. They play with and alongside each other while engaging in experiences that interest them.</p><p>Children have access to a wide variety of thoughtfully presented resources in a well-organised environment. Teachers have made good use of the available outdoor space to provide for children's holistic development. Children's cultural backgrounds are reflected in wall displays and resources. Culturally significant events are celebrated and well documented.</p><p>Teachers interact respectfully with children and are available to them. They promote children's learning and wellbeing by:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>their commitment to enacting the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>monitoring and talking to children about their wellbeing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>intentionally promoting literacy and numeracy in meaningful ways in all areas of play</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>encouraging and affirming children as they play and learn</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>their positive relationship with the local primary school to support children's successful transition to school.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>Teachers are focused on building strong relationships with parents and whānau by using a variety of communication strategies. Parents who spoke to ERO were positive about the kindergarten and appreciated the work of teachers.</p><p>Teachers discuss children's interests and dispositions, and identify strategies to extend and deepen their learning. Assessments show improvement over time with the identification of children's learning dispositions. Links between children's learning and the programme are becoming more visible. Teachers could further develop ways to gather, record and respond to parents' aspirations, to strengthen learning partnerships.</p><p>Changes in staffing and leadership at the kindergarten have been well managed to minimise disruption to children and families. The EM provides support for teachers to identify and address areas for improvement. As a recently formed team, it would be useful for teachers to work towards developing a shared vision of improving professional practices. They could also better record their decision making regarding children's learning in assessment, planning and evaluation.</p><p>Professional learning and development opportunities that are provided for teachers include a focus on 'appreciative inquiry' and other frameworks for internal evaluation.</p><p>CMKA strategic goals and the kindergarten's annual planning help to create improvements in teaching practice, learning environments and outcomes for children and their whānau. Teachers should consider further refining annual plan goals so that they are more specific.</p><p>Well established CMKA management systems, policies and processes guide the kindergarten's practices. Embedding the practice of regular documented observations into the CMKA appraisal process could enhance the support provided for teachers' professional growth.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Leaders and teachers agree that key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthening leadership in teaching and learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>developing a shared understanding about implementing a process for internal evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continuing to develop evaluation of learning and teaching to strengthen teaching practice and improve outcomes for children.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>CMKA leaders agree that their next steps are to continue:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>providing consistent ongoing support for leaders and teachers that sustains leadership and improves teaching practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>implementing <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the revised early childhood curriculum, to identify priorities for learning and evaluation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>supporting teachers to increase the visibility of children's cultural identity and continuity of learning in their individual portfolios</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>building capability and depth in internal evaluation across the association.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Manurewa West Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Manurewa West Kindergarten will be in three years.</p><p>Violet Tu’uga Stevenson</p><p>Director Review and Improvement Services</p><p><span>Te Tai Raki - Northern Region</span></p><p>21 December 2018</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="width: 621px;"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"><i>ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</i><em><span>.</span></em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-schools-and-kura/return-times-for-school-reviews/" class="ss-broken">ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
