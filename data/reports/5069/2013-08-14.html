</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Massey Kindergarten in West Auckland operates as a kindergarten day model (KDM) where children can attend for either morning sessions or all day. The kindergarten is licensed for 30 children over 2 years of age. The roll reflects the cultural diversity of the Massey community.</p><p>The teaching team of qualified staff has been together for three years and know the community well. The kindergarten’s philosophy and vision statement reflect teachers’ commitment to high quality support for children and families.</p><p>The kindergarten operates as part of the Auckland Kindergarten Association (AKA). The association provides policy, procedural and operating guidelines. It also provides teachers with regular, topical professional development and on-going support from professional managers.</p><p>The kindergarten has a history of positive ERO reports. Changes since the 2010 ERO review include the upgrading of, and extensions to, kindergarten facilities.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of ten kindergarten reviews in the Auckland Kindergarten Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children enjoy a rich, broad curriculum with <em>Te Whāriki</em>, New Zealand’s early childhood curriculum framework, as the foundation. Teachers provide inviting play areas and are thoughtful about programme provision and resources to cater for all children. Children make independent choices and confidently engage in cooperative play. Their decisions and interests guide a programme that provides many opportunities for children to grow as capable and confident learners.</p><p>Teachers skilfully engage with children as they play and demonstrate a genuine respect for their thoughts and ideas. Displays and records are accessible to parents and children, and clearly show how learning develops over time. Opportunities to learn early literacy and mathematics skills are included in many ways across the programme. Children and teachers include some te reo Māori naturally as they talk together.</p><p>Teachers continue to deepen their understanding of what success as Māori looks like for Māori children in an early childhood context. They value input from Māori whānau in this endeavour. Kindergarten documentation is increasingly reflecting this commitment to acknowledging tangata whenua and Te Tiriti o Waitangi.</p><p>Teachers actively seek the input of whānau and respond to parents’ aspirations for their children’s learning. Parents are an important part of the centre’s becoming involved in the Enviroschools project and its emphasis on environmental sustainability.</p><p>Teachers use self review and reflective practice to promote ongoing improvement to the quality of teaching and learning. They enquire into their own practice to promote ongoing improvement to outcomes for children and families. Their systematic and purposeful self review is responsive to external review and to internal priorities and strategic goals. Professional learning and development is targeted to support the achievement of centre goals.</p><p>Teachers work together in open, collaborative ways and are a high performing team. They share the leadership of initiatives and utilise their strengths to realise the kindergarten’s vision. Performance appraisal also contributes to improvement and is completed in a professional, responsible manner.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>ERO and teachers agree that teachers should continue to explore additional ways to:</p><ul>
<li>acknowledge all cultures represented in the kindergarten through the programme and in the environment</li>
<li>develop their transition to school processes and practices</li>
<li>encourage children’s verbal communication to strengthen their oral literacy.</li>
</ul><h4>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h4><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Massey Kindergarten completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p><p>The next ERO review of Massey Kindergarten will be in four years.</p><p>Graham Randell</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region (Acting)</p><p>14 August 2013</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</table><a id="3-general-information-about-early-childhood-reviews" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 General Information about Early Childhood Reviews</h2><h3>ERO’s Evaluation Framework</h3><p>ERO’s overarching question for an early childhood education review is ‘How well placed is this service to promote positive learning outcomes for children?’ ERO focuses on the following factors as described in the bicultural framework <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">Ngā Pou Here:</a></p><ul>
<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><ul>
<li><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></li>
<li>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</li>
<li>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</li>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
