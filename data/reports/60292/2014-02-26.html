</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Children First Early Childhood Centre is a privately owned centre in Upper Hutt. It provides full-day education and care for children from eight months to five years of age.</p><p>Since the 2010 ERO review the centre has merged two licenses. It is now licensed for 45 children including 10 under two years of age.</p><p>Children First is located on two adjoining sites. Parents are able to choose which site best suits the needs of their child.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>The centre philosophy clearly articulates a shared vision. Staff aim to provide an environment where children can develop to their full potential and grow into confident and competent learners. Teachers provide structured and child-directed learning.</p><p>Children access an appropriate range of resources to support their interests. Literacy and numeracy activities are used by teachers with individuals and groups. They are also available for children to use independently. The local community is purposefully accessed to promote children’s learning experiences outside the centre.</p><p>Opportunities for uninterrupted play enable children to pursue their interests and direct their exploration. They participate cooperatively with their peers, learning to negotiate outcomes, share their enjoyment and take turns.</p><p>Children up to two years of age receive appropriate care. Each centre has its own outdoor environment specifically for children up to two years of age. Infants, toddlers and young children are provided with opportunities to play together. Adults respond promptly to infants' emotional cues. Individual interests and abilities are identified and discussed with parents.</p><p>Teachers demonstrate positive and supportive relationships with children. They encourage individuals to become involved in activities and experiences to motivate their learning.</p><p>Some adult interactions build on the complexity of children’s learning. Increasing the capability of all staff to respond comprehensively to the diverse needs of children through contextual learning experiences, should improve outcomes for children.</p><p>Appraisal of teachers has been strengthened in 2013 to monitor and build their practice. Staff self assess against key indicators of effective practice contained in the Registered Teacher Criteria. Teachers demonstrate useful reflection about their practice. Supporting teachers to provide evidence of improved practice should increase their review and evaluation skills.</p><p>Parents view the inclusive environment as one that supports positive outcomes for children. They affirm the progress their children make while attending the centre. Parents are included in conversations and access children’s learning journals to support their knowledge of each child's learning. Teachers regularly discuss children’s learning at home and in the centre with parents. Staff know children and their families well.</p><p>Useful review of bicultural practice has been undertaken recently. The review has considered teachers' current practice and identified of how best to build capability and inform curriculum expectations. This has impacted on teachers' ability to increase the level, frequency and inclusion of te reo Māori in their daily practice. It is timely for teachers to examine <em>Tātaiako – cultural competencies for teachers</em>, and further develop their curriculum to include relevant cultural contexts.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders and teachers should comprehensively review, revise and consider the impact of their curriculum delivery on outcomes for children. Staff should consider improving the:</p><ul>
<li>responsiveness of the programme and the current planning process to children’s interests. Planning should show how teachers are recognising the emergent curriculum</li>
<li>access to the physical environment during the day to support children to better follow their interests.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Children First Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Children First Early Learning Centre will be in three years</p><p><img title="" src="assets/index-html-m2a7690f7.gif" alt=""></p><p>Joyce Gebbie</p><p>National Manager Review Services Central Region (Acting)</p><p>26 February 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
