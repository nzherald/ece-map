<html><a id="1-evaluation-of-the-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>1 Evaluation of the Service</h2><h3>How well placed is the service to promote positive outcomes for children?</h3><p>Central Kids Kindergartens - Kihikihi is very well placed to promote positive outcomes for children.</p><h3>Context</h3><p>Central Kids Kindergartens - Kihikihi is located in Kihikihi just south of Te Awamutu. It operates under the umbrella of the Central Kids Kindergarten Trust (Trust), formerly known as Central North Island Kindergarten Association. Currently, 40 children are enrolled, of whom 8 are identified as M&#257;ori.</p><p>Since the previous ERO review, there has been one new appointment to the teaching staff. The head teacher and teaching team continue to provide a welcoming and inclusive learning culture for children, their families and wh&#257;nau. Considerable upgrades to the kindergarten environment include the addition of a teachers&rsquo; office and resource room, and a kitchenette for the children&rsquo;s kai area.</p><p>Teachers have recently reviewed the kindergarten&rsquo;s philosophy in consultation with parents and wh&#257;nau. They have developed a whakatau&#257;k&#299; that aims to encompass all that the teachers believe and do.</p><p><em>&lsquo;Ma te ako, ma te tipu, ka neke whakamua tatou.</em></p><p><em> As we grow, and as we learn, we move forward together.&rsquo;</em></p><p>This review was conducted as part of a cluster approach to reviews in eleven early childhood education services within the Central North Island Kindergarten Trust umbrella organisation.</p><h3>Review Findings</h3><p>Children learn and play in a welcoming, well-resourced environment that is focused on their wellbeing, and recognises their individual strengths and interests. Teachers provide children with extensive learning opportunities through the design and preparation of the kindergarten environment. They listen, and ask children open questions that prompt thought and investigation. Children are able to explore their ideas, increase their knowledge and confidence, and recognise their success. Teachers support and empower children to:</p><ul>
<li>make sense of the natural and physical worlds</li>
<li>engage in creative and imaginative play</li>
<li>participate in music, and singing</li>
<li>experience many opportunities to extend their literacy and mathematics knowledge and skills.</li>
</ul><p>Teachers develop close relationships with children and their families, and are able to use their understanding of children&rsquo;s interests and parents&rsquo; aspirations to inform their planning. They take care to recognise, and respond to opportunities to engage in and extend children&rsquo;s learning. This learning is recorded in well-presented portfolios and displayed on the kindergarten walls for children, parents/wh&#257;nau and teachers to revisit. Teachers discuss the learning stories with children and their families.</p><p>A recent focus for teacher professional development and learning has been to review and extend the integration of bicultural perspectives in the kindergarten programme. Teachers value the cultural context by acknowledging and respecting whakapapa, tikanga and te reo M&#257;ori. Children are enjoying opportunities to sing waiata, use te reo, poi and harakeke, and explore the history of the local environment and the features significant to iwi.</p><p>Leaders and teachers place strong priority on contributing to positive outcomes for children in a high quality, inclusive environment. The head teacher encourages teachers to share leadership roles and further their professional learning. Teachers reflect deeply on their teaching practice and are informed by current research and best practice in early childhood education. Self review follows a planned process that is focused on improving outcomes for children, their families and wh&#257;nau.</p><p>The kindergarten is well supported by the Central North Island Kindergarten Trust. The professional leader provides informative feedback, support and encouragement to the head teacher and staff. The kindergarten identifies annual goals for development that are linked to the Trust&rsquo;s strategic priorities, self review, and teachers&rsquo; professional development and appraisal.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Teachers have developed productive partnerships with parents and wh&#257;nau and include culturally important contexts in the programme. Kindergarten leaders and teachers agree that the next step is to increase the M&#257;ori world view in assessments of children&rsquo;s learning.</p><a id="2-legal-requirements" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Legal Requirements</h2><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Central Kids Kindergartens - Kihikihi completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service&rsquo;s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><a id="3-next-review" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>3 Next Review</h2><h3>When is ERO likely to review the early childhood service again?</h3><p>ERO is likely to carry out the next review in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services</p><p>Northern Region</p><p>13 May 2013</p><a id="information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO evaluates how well placed the service is to make and sustain improvements for the benefit of all children at the service. To reach these findings ERO considers:</p><ul>
<li>Pou Whakahaere &ndash; how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Pou &#256;rahi &ndash; how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>M&#257;tauranga &ndash; whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li>Tikanga whakaako &ndash; how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
