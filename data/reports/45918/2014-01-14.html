</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Scuola Montessori is a privately owned service, located in Waihi Road Tauranga. This is the first ERO review of the centre, which has been operating for eighteen months. The centre is fully licensed under the <em>Education (Early Childhood Services) Regulations 2008</em>, to provide sessional and all-day care for 30 children, including eight under the age of two.</p><p>Centre owners/managers have systematically employed qualified early childhood teachers and a high proportion are trained in the Montessori approach. The centre owners take an active role in day-to-day operations. A vision statement based on Montessori principles is at the heart of centre practices and is strongly represented in the programme and the environment.</p><p>Since opening in May 2012, owner/managers have developed sound systems and policy guidelines for key operations. An ongoing process of policy review is being implemented. Developing and resourcing the environment has been an early priority, and development is continuing. There has been a change to the leadership team, with a new head directress being appointed in January 2013.</p><p>The centre is beginning to develop positive relationships with its parent community. Regular newsletters to families and surveys seeking their viewpoints are assisting management to build this partnership. Supporting children and families during the period when they prepare to transition to school is a focal area for development. A network is already established with a nearby primary school which has Montessori classes.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Owner/managers are providing sound management structures and clear direction for the staff. Good strategic and financial management has been instrumental in the provision of a well-resourced environment for a growing roll. Centre owners are continuing to develop aspects of the physical layout of the building to improve access and available space, especially for babies and toddlers.</p><p>Leadership of the curriculum (learning and teaching) by the head directress is an area for continuing development. Expectations for this role have recently been clarified and now need to be communicated to all members of the teaching team. This is necessary to ensure a collective understanding of, and commitment to, the agreed philosophical approach to teaching, and the curriculum in action. The head directress is well supported by management and has undertaken some leadership training.</p><p>The curriculum strongly reflects the Montessori approach and is being implemented by a team of teachers who are knowledgeable about this approach to learning and teaching. The environment has been arranged and resourced to support this curriculum design. Teachers' model learning using equipment and the values of grace and gratitude are integral to the programme. Assessment planning and evaluation practices are still developing under the leadership of the head directress. Teachers record their observations of children’s learning in individual profiles and these are shared with parents. It is important that teachers develop assessment practices that effectively document children’s interests, and then the intentional planning as a result of this learning. Expectations for teachers about assessment and planning need to be clear and well documented for shared and ongoing reference by the team.</p><p>Teachers work hard to prepare and present an environment that engages children with materials that promote sensorial learning, life skills, independence and self management for sustained periods of time. Children interact freely with their environment and are familiar with routines. They play happily with and alongside their peers. Teachers have undertaken professional development about positive guidance strategies. Children, toddlers and babies are well supported to develop social competencies in a caring and nurturing environment.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Agreed priorities for review and development are:</p><ul>
<li>leadership roles and responsibilities for the head directress, to ensure that these are made explicit and are communicated to all teaching staff</li>
<li>the philosophy for learning and teaching, to ensure that this is agreed and well understood, and that expectations for teachers are clear</li>
<li>the curriculum design to ensure consistent implementation of a programme that is strong in Montessori principles and practices, but which also takes account of <em>Te Whariki</em>, the early childhood curriculum, and bicultural perspectives</li>
<li>provision for babies and toddlers in the environment.</li>
</ul><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>That centre managers seek and engage an external facilitator for ongoing centre-wide professional development for all teaching staff in relation to assessment, planning and evaluation. This should occur in conjunction with the review and development of the philosophy and curriculum.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Scuola Montessori completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>In order to improve the sleep provisions for children:</p><ul>
<li>The centre owners and head directress will undertake a review of the sleep room for children in order to ensure a safe, designated place for rest and sleep.</li>
</ul><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Scuola Montessori will be in three years.</p><p>Dale Bailey</p><p>National Manager Review Services Northern Region</p><p>14 January 2014</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/part-4-eros-framework-for-review-nga-pou-here/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="http://www.ero.govt.nz/Review-Process/For-Early-Childhood-Services-and-Nga-Kohanga-Reo/ERO-Reviews-of-Early-Childhood-Services/Draft-criteria-for-ERO-s-review-return-times-for-early-childhood-services."> ERO’s website</a>.</p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
