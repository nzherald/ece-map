</table><p>Ilam Early Learning Centre is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Ilam Early Learning Centre is one of two early childhood centres owned and operated by the University of Canterbury Students’ Association. The centre is located on the University campus.</p><p>Ilam Early Learning Centre provides care and education for infants, toddlers and children to school age. Many families are from countries other than New Zealand. A number of parents attend the university for varying lengths of time. As a result of this, some children attend the centre for short periods of time.</p><p>The centre is licensed for a maximum of 55 children. This includes up to 25 children under two years of age. It is organised into three separate areas to cater for the specific learning needs of children. There are a high number of qualified early childhood teachers. The ratio of teachers to children is better than minimum requirements.</p><p>Centre leaders are part of the local community cluster of early childhood centres and primary schools. The cluster promotes professional networks to support teaching and learning across the sectors.</p><p>Leaders and teachers have acted on the recommendations from the June 2012 education review. This includes developing child assessment and programme planning, transition to school processes, bicultural perspectives, reflective practices, strategic planning and self-review systems.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Children are well supported to develop a strong sense of belonging in a child-centred learning programme based on <em>Te Whāriki</em>, the New Zealand Early Childhood Curriculum. They benefit from positive, responsive relationships with their teachers. They enjoy a wide range of creative and expressive arts experiences.</p><p>Literacy and numeracy are carefully integrated into the programme in ways that are meaningful to children and their learning. Oral language development is a strong focus of the curriculum. Teachers work effectively with families to support children with English as an additional language. Visitors to the centre and excursions into the community enrich the learning programme offered to children.</p><p>Children are encouraged to develop independence, take responsibility for themselves and to support others with their learning. Children have many opportunities to learn about the bicultural heritage of Aotearoa New Zealand and the cultures of those attending the centre.</p><p>Teachers have a strong focus on developing collaborative, positive relationships with children, parents and whānau. They foster reciprocal interactions with and among children.</p><p>Teachers have shared values and use similar approaches to working with children. The language, culture and identity of children and their families is well respected. They are inclusive and sensitive to their diverse community.</p><p>The individual needs of infants and toddlers are well supported through caring and nurturing interactions with their teachers. Routines are well paced, flexible, and valued as learning opportunities for children.</p><p>Transitions into the centre, between areas and on to school are well planned and inclusive of families.</p><p>Teachers foster strong partnerships with families to support the learning and wellbeing of children. This helps provide continuity of care and routines between home and centre. Parents and whānau are well informed about their children’s interests and participation in the learning programme through attractive learning journals and wall displays. Teachers value the views and contributions of parents and whānau.</p><p>The centre is well led and managed. Leaders and teachers work collaboratively and have a strong shared focus on providing positive outcomes for children and families.</p><p>Management make good provision for professional development. Staff have many opportunities to develop leadership skills and reflect on their practice.</p><p>Leaders and teachers make good use of self-review processes to bring about worthwhile changes to learning and teaching. Teachers are well supported to develop their understandings and use of self review and develop reflective practice.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>Centre leaders and ERO agree, that the key next steps for improving outcomes for children include:</p><ul>
<li>refining strategic planning</li>
<li>strengthening child assessment processes</li>
<li>including bicultural perspectives in key documentation.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Ilam Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Ilam Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Chris Rowe</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer Southern (Acting)</p><p>2 October 2015</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em><a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/"> ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
