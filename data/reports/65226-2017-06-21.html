</table><p>The centre is well placed to promote positive learning outcomes for children.</p><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Reefton Early Learning Centre provides care and education for up to 28 children from birth to school age. The nursery area has its own outdoor space. Children aged over two years have a separate indoor and outdoor area.</p><p>In July 2015 this service moved to new premises and increased the days the service is open from two days a week to five days a week. Many children attend part-time. The board and staff are still developing some aspects of the new environment, such as the outdoor spaces and equipment.</p><p>There have also been a number of ongoing staff changes, including employing more staff to meet extended days of centre operation. Qualified early childhood teachers are supported in the daily programme by untrained teaching assistants. A manager oversees the daily operation of the centre. A board of parents and community members provide governance.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p>Interactions between staff and children and among children are positive and affirming. Teachers know children and families well and make good use of this information to extend children's learning. Staff make effective use of their interactions with children to encourage them to talk about their play, develop their ideas and extend their thinking.</p><p>Children experience an unhurried programme with a good range of play activities. Children are encouraged to make their own choices, take responsibility for their own decisions and understand the impact of their actions.</p><p>Infants and toddlers are effectively and safely included alongside older children as well as having their own space for uninterrupted play. Staff are very responsive to the needs of infants and toddlers.</p><p>Teachers build positive and affirming relationships with families. They are developing more structured and documented processes for seeking and responding to parents' aspirations for their children’s learning, including seeking Māori whānau voice.</p><p>Teachers promote children's learning about the natural environment and environmental sustainability. This includes demonstrating effective practices in involving parents, reflecting community values, and linking to aspects of a local school curriculum.</p><p>The centre has strong relationships within the local community to support children's learning. The development of the new centre premises was community driven to meet local needs. It has provided an opportunity for more children in the area to access early childhood education. Close links with local schools are supporting children's successful transition to school.</p><p>The early childhood trained teachers regularly seek new ideas and have recently initiated some useful developments that are better supporting the planning and assessment for individual children. Collaborative planning practices among staff are more evident and untrained teachers are being supported to contribute more to centre planning and grow their practice.</p><p>The committed governance board has skilled trustees with good levels of expertise and useful connections to the centre, early childhood education and within the community.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><p>The board and centre manager had not fully anticipated the impact that a five day a week service would have on management and centre leadership. The leaders need to develop key documentation and systems that will help guide teaching and learning now it is operating on a daily basis.</p><p>Completion of the review of the philosophy is a priority to provide clearer expectations for teaching and learning. This review will also support more systematic strategic planning and internal evaluation.</p><p>Other key next steps include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>strengthening the process and documentation of internal evaluation and strategic planning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>improving appraisal practices, including developing a better understanding of the requirements of the Education Council for teacher registration renewal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>successfully implementing plans for new programme planning and assessment practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>increasing bicultural practices.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The board and centre leader need to ensure they have focused plans to support centre sustainability in staffing now that the number of sessions has increased.</p><h3>Recommendation</h3><p>ERO recommends the board and centre manager seek external support to improve centre practices around strategic planning, internal evaluation and appraisal.</p><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Reefton Early Learning Centre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>. In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><h4>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</h4><p>The next ERO review of Reefton Early Learning Centre will be in three years.</p><p>Dr Lesley Patterson</p><p>Deputy Chief Review Officer - Southern/Te Waipounamu</p><p>21 June 2017</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table style="width: 621px;" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7"><colgroup> <col> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup> <colgroup> <col></colgroup>

<li><em>Pou Whakahaere</em> – how the service determines its vision, philosophy and direction to ensure positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Pou Ārahi</em> – how leadership is enacted to enhance positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Mātauranga</em> – whose knowledge is valued and how the curriculum is designed to achieve positive outcomes for children</li>
<li><em>Tikanga whakaako</em> – how approaches to teaching and learning respond to diversity and support positive outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><p>Within these areas ERO considers the effectiveness of <em>arotake</em> – self review and of <em>whanaungatanga</em> – partnerships with parents and whānau.</p><p>ERO evaluates how well placed a service is to sustain good practice and make ongoing improvements for the benefit of all children at the service.</p><p>A focus for the government is that all children, especially priority learners, have an opportunity to benefit from quality early childhood education. ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services</a><em><span>.</span></em></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
