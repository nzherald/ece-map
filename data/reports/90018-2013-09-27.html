</table><p>ERO's findings that support this overall judgement are summarised below.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Children at Roslyn Bush Playcentre enjoy a stimulating, interesting programme. Roslyn Bush Playcentre is one of 19 Playcentres governed by the Southland Playcentre Association (SPA). It is a rural centre close to Invercargill. Children may attend up to four morning sessions a week but most come for two, attending other early childhood services on the other days.</p><p>An experienced, well-qualified, paid educator ensures a focus on learning and provides continuity for all sessions. Parents who spoke to ERO said that this arrangement suits their lifestyles and enables them to be involved in their children’s learning at a manageable level.</p><p>Since the June 2010 review, the parents and educator have improved the planning and assessment practices and there is now a strong bicultural dimension in the daily programme.</p><p>This review was part of a cluster of 17 playcentre reviews in the Southland Playcentre Association.</p><h3>The Review Findings</h3><p><em>Relationships</em>. Children and their families benefit from positive, supportive relationships within the playcentre. They are made to feel very welcome. Parents effectively support and welcome new families. Children are very settled and have a strong sense of belonging in the centre. The parents work well together. They are encouraging and friendly as they work alongside their own and other children. They know children’s next learning steps and, with the educator, actively support them to achieve these.</p><p><em>Environment</em>. Children play and learn in well-resourced and spacious indoor and outdoor areas. The indoor area is welcoming, well organised and has recently been improved to encourage children’s creative, imaginative and dramatic play. The outdoor area has many natural resources and spaces that challenge children and develop their physical skills.</p><p><em>Curriculum</em>. Children experience a rich curriculum. There are a wide variety of activities for children to participate in both inside and out. Their learning is enhanced with many excursions such as, the marae, beach and polyfest. These excursions and events add depth to the programme as children later are encouraged to recall them and use them in their play.</p><p>Each term a group-learning focus is selected in response to children’s general interests. A wide variety of experiences are planned to expand and extend the learning. There is a strong focus on building early literacy and numeracy skills and supporting children’s social development. Children are supported to learn te reo and tikanga Māori. The expertise of a local person was used to teach the tikanga around harakeke (flax weaving). There is thoughtful provision for and awareness of the requirements of infants and toddlers.</p><p><em>Planning</em>. Since the June 2010 review the educator and parents have made significant improvements in the way they plan for children’s learning. The educator has particularly good skills in showing how children’s learning becomes more complex over time. The educator and parent helpers have a very good awareness of children’s goals and actively support children to achieve these through intentional actions over the session. The activities provided are deliberately chosen to support children’s goals.</p><p><em>Teaching practice</em> The educator is a very good role model for adults and children. She keeps a strong focus on learning throughout the sessions, over time and in the pre and post-session discussions. She has close relationships with the children and through skilled questioning and conversations extends their learning and thinking.</p><p><em>Southland Playcentre Association support.</em> The SPA provides strong support to the playcentre through:</p><ul>
<li>ongoing adult education</li>
<li>twice termly visits by the playcentre liaison officer</li>
<li>property and maintenance advice</li>
<li>additional funding as required</li>
<li>help to meet relicensing requirements</li>
<li>a policy and strategic planning framework</li>
<li>sound governance practices.</li>
</ul><p>The SPA provides strong leadership to guide the future direction and ongoing improvement of all its centres. This includes the way association team members' foster emergent leadership. Currently there are high numbers of people participating in playcentre training. The association has identified, and ERO agrees, that its next step is to improve its knowledge and understanding of self review. It then needs to support playcentres to implement effective self review.</p><h3>Key Next Steps</h3><ul>
<li><em>Self review</em>. Aspects of self-review practices are in place. Some reviews have resulted in positive changes to the centre environment. The next step is for self review to include in-depth reflection, evaluation and be aligned to indicators of best practice.</li>
<li><em>Strategic planning</em>. This would be more useful if detail about how the set goals might be met and indicators of what good practice would look like were a key part of this document. It would also be appropriate to have a greater focus on improving outcomes for children.</li>
</ul><h3>Management Assurance on Legal Requirements</h3><p>Before the review, the staff and management of Roslyn Bush Playcentre completed an <em>ERO Centre Assurance Statement and Self-Audit Checklist</em>.</p><p>In these documents they attested that they have taken all reasonable steps to meet their legal obligations related to:</p><ul>
<li>curriculum</li>
<li>premises and facilities</li>
<li>health and safety practices</li>
<li>governance, management and administration.</li>
</ul><p>During the review, ERO looked at the service’s systems for managing the following areas that have a potentially high impact on children's wellbeing:</p><ul>
<li>emotional safety (including positive guidance and child protection)</li>
<li>physical safety (including supervision; sleep procedures; accidents; medication; hygiene; excursion policies and procedures)</li>
<li>suitable staffing (including qualification levels; police vetting; teacher registration; ratios)</li>
<li>evacuation procedures and practices for fire and earthquake.</li>
</ul><p>All early childhood services are required to promote children's health and safety and to regularly review their compliance with legal requirements.</p><p>ERO found that risks for excursions beyond the playcentre need to be better identified and managed. The risk analysis and management system needs to be improved to show more clearly how the identified hazards will be eliminated, isolated or minimised.</p><h3>Next ERO Review</h3><p>When is ERO likely to review the service again?</p><p>The next ERO review of Roslyn Bush Playcentre will be in three years.</p><p>Graham Randell National Manager Review Services Southern Region</p><p>27 September 2013</p><h3>The Purpose of ERO Reports</h3><p>The Education Review Office (ERO) is the government department that, as part of its work, reviews early childhood services throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. ERO’s reports provide information for parents and communities about each service’s strengths and next steps for development. ERO’s bicultural evaluation framework Ngā Pou Here is described in SECTION 3 of this report. Early childhood services are partners in the review process and are expected to make use of the review findings to enhance children's wellbeing and learning.</p><a id="2-information-about-the-early-childhood-service" class="toc-anchor"></a><h2>2 Information about the Early Childhood Service</h2><table>

ERO will report on how well each service promotes positive outcomes for all children, with a focus on children who are Māori, Pacific, have diverse needs, and are up to the age of two.</p><p><em>For more information about the framework and Ngā Pou Here refer to</em> <a href="/publications/he-pou-tataki-how-ero-reviews-early-childhood-services/">ERO’s Approach to Review in Early Childhood Services<em>.</em></a></p><h3>ERO’s Overall Judgement and Next Review</h3><p>The overall judgement that ERO makes and the timing of the next review will depend on how well placed a service is to promote positive learning outcomes for children. The categories are:</p><ul>
<li>Very well placed – The next ERO review in four years</li>
<li>Well placed – The next ERO review in three years</li>
<li>Requires further development – The next ERO review within two years</li>
<li>Not well placed - The next ERO review in consultation with the Ministry of Education</li>
</ul><p>ERO has developed criteria for each category. These are available on <a href="/how-ero-reviews/ero-reviews-of-early-childhood-services-and-kohanga-reo/return-times-for-early-childhood-service-reviews/">ERO’s website.</a></p><h3>Review Coverage</h3><p>ERO reviews are tailored to each service’s context and performance, within the overarching review framework. The aim is to provide information on aspects that are central to positive outcomes for children and useful to the service.</p>
